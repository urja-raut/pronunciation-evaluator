( train_assamesemale_01408 " the town people know that the bridge is the only reason. " )
( train_assamesemale_01409 " why the local college could not progress well so far. " )

( train_assamesemale_01411 " this river has divided the town in two . " )
( train_assamesemale_01412 " it has created some division in some minds straining relationships between them. " )

( train_assamesemale_01492 " she would then close the gate lightly. " )
( train_assamesemale_01493 " she would stumble upon that floor of memories. " )
( train_assamesemale_01494 " i was walking with a new sensation. " )
( train_assamesemale_01495 " i was thinking about bipul about bringing him home. " )
( train_assamesemale_01496 " the loadshedding would be over soon. " )
( train_assamesemale_01497 " i must reach home before the street lights lit up the road. " )

( train_assamesemale_01503 " he came under the umbrella and walked across that bamboo bridge. " )
( train_assamesemale_01504 " he was still thinking of namita and some thoughts rose in me too. " )
( train_assamesemale_01505 " young boys like you should approach a minister and build that bridge soon. " )
( train_assamesemale_01506 " suddenly the words left my lips. " )
( train_assamesemale_01507 " the bridge is so vital to them to their relationship. " )
( train_assamesemale_01508 " perhaps there is nothing strange nothing strange about the way. " )
( train_assamesemale_01509 " i have cursed under my breath. " )
( train_assamesemale_01510 " my situation has been reduced to such a precarious one. " )
( train_assamesemale_01511 " no longer possible for me to sing or chant mantras. " )

( train_assamesemale_01513 " i have cleverly placed myself beneath the umbrella. " )
( train_assamesemale_01514 " like circle shed of the traffic point. " )
( train_assamesemale_01515 " this must surely be indicative of my far sightness. " )
( train_assamesemale_01516 " i had not paused here for a while. " )

( train_assamesemale_01525 " its occasional shelter turned domain has brought about an unknown fear in it. " )
( train_assamesemale_01526 " the fear of being ousted from its own territory. " )
( train_assamesemale_01527 " i need to pull apart of darkness and peer at that part of me. " )

( train_assamesemale_01729 " mina had never seen shanties like this before. " )

( train_assamesemale_01735 " his parents brother and sister live in that tiny house. " )
( train_assamesemale_01736 " it was jagua and his family members shrank in size. " )
( train_assamesemale_01737 " like the genie in a bottle in an arabian tale. " )
( train_assamesemale_01738 " in order to squeeze into their home. " )

( train_assamesemale_01743 " mina got a fleeting glimpse of the interior. " )
( train_assamesemale_01744 " which was a source of great wonder and curiosity for her. " )
( train_assamesemale_01745 " strange inside that there was a small cave. " )
( train_assamesemale_01746 " a bed wrapped around with rags in one corner. " )
( train_assamesemale_01747 " a small and battered trunk. " )
( train_assamesemale_01748 " an aluminum kadai and a few plates. " )
( train_assamesemale_01749 " there was also a locked and covered rusty old tin. " )

( train_assamesemale_01757 " however after observing the condition of jaguas family. " )
( train_assamesemale_01758 " she feels even a poor thief. " )
( train_assamesemale_01759 " they would not take the trouble to ransack their box. " )
( train_assamesemale_01760 " they had another possession which lay right near their doorstep. " )
( train_assamesemale_01761 " and not inside the jhuggi. " )
( train_assamesemale_01762 " this was a chula stove. " )

( train_assamesemale_01764 " once in a while she made some curries too. " )

( train_assamesemale_01769 " at that time semi darkness presented a prehistoric tableau to mina. " )
( train_assamesemale_01770 " actually they were like ghosts in this ghost town. " )
( train_assamesemale_01771 " not that mina felt any surge of pity. " )
( train_assamesemale_01772 " when she saw the frugal meal being eaten. " )
( train_assamesemale_01773 " it seemed as if the hot and puffed rotis would be very tasty. " )
( train_assamesemale_01774 " mina herself failed to make such hot and puffed rotis. " )

( train_assamesemale_01779 " mina felt that the entire atmosphere was so squalid. " )
( train_assamesemale_01780 " when she really thought about one of those rotis. " )
( train_assamesemale_01781 " this spectral lot wearing dirty rags. " )
( train_assamesemale_01782 " a veritable hell out of the place where they dwelt. " )

( train_assamesemale_01788 " the watery stool even stain the ground near. " )

( train_assamesemale_01833 " it would be a big relief. " )
( train_assamesemale_01834 " he could also be put to work. " )

( train_assamesemale_01867 " the bus stops were well shaded by trees and very comfortable. " )
( train_assamesemale_01868 " sometimes the bus travelled a long way. " )
( train_assamesemale_01869 " mina really riding aboard delhis buses. " )
( train_assamesemale_01870 " moreover now it was the middle of march. " )
( train_assamesemale_01871 " and it was spring in delhi. " )
( train_assamesemale_01872 " it was not just the pleasant weather. " )
( train_assamesemale_01873 " which made travelling a joy. " )
( train_assamesemale_01874 " the flowers that had burst resplendently into bloom. " )
( train_assamesemale_01875 " everywhere in the city sore eyes. " )
( train_assamesemale_01876 " they animated peoples hearts. " )
( train_assamesemale_01877 " it was not only in the parks. " )
( train_assamesemale_01878 " one could see a carnival of flowers. " )
( train_assamesemale_01879 " it was not only in the parks. " )
( train_assamesemale_01880 " one could see a carnival of flowers. " )
( train_assamesemale_01881 " the hillock which was the circle. " )
( train_assamesemale_01882 " which the radial roads led off. " )
( train_assamesemale_01883 " it was also transformed into a carpet. " )
( train_assamesemale_01884 " full colourful flowers by the concerned authorities. " )
( train_assamesemale_01885 " mina gazed at the splendid display of flowers with rapt. " )
( train_assamesemale_01886 " admiring eyes and hummed silently to herself. " )
( train_assamesemale_01887 " because beauty chants a prayer for blooming the whole night. " )
( train_assamesemale_01888 " the morning is chocked with flowers and flowers. " )
( train_assamesemale_01889 " really delhis spring intoxicated mina. " )
( train_assamesemale_01890 " the columnists who wrote the city diaries. " )
( train_assamesemale_01891 " that appeared in delhis newspapers. " )
( train_assamesemale_01892 " these were to ecstatic in their descriptions. " )
( train_assamesemale_01893 " the spring and of the riot of flowers. " )
( train_assamesemale_01894 " mina wondered whether these journalists could identify the flowers. " )
( train_assamesemale_01895 " they named poppy pansy hollyhock carnation ornflower. " )
( train_assamesemale_01896 " may be they could. " )
( train_assamesemale_01897 " otherwise how could they compare a pansy to karl marx head. " )
( train_assamesemale_01898 " mina started after rajib returned home. " )
( train_assamesemale_01899 " my spring disappears into my office files. " )
( train_assamesemale_01900 " enjoy your spring among colourful flowers. " )
( train_assamesemale_01901 " what a difference of fortune. " )
( train_assamesemale_01902 " between two creatures living in the same house. " )
( train_assamesemale_01903 " when mina heard rajib say things like this. " )
( train_assamesemale_01904 " jaguas families spring was spent in a far worse manner. " )
( train_assamesemale_01905 " because it was spent among brisk sand and cement. " )
( train_assamesemale_01906 " for the last two days jagua had . " )
( train_assamesemale_01907 " he either lay upine inside their cave of a shanty. " )
( train_assamesemale_01908 " sat among the rubbish in front of their home. " )
( train_assamesemale_01909 " with a forlorn look of his face. " )
( train_assamesemale_01910 " that he had fever thats why he had to stay at . " )
( train_assamesemale_01911 " mina realized that indeed not well. " )
( train_assamesemale_01912 " he had not promptly and greedily bitten the biscuit given to him. " )
( train_assamesemale_01913 " he was sitting there clutching . " )
( train_assamesemale_01914 " although he was not running around. " )
( train_assamesemale_01915 " he had picked among the rubbish for pieces of papers torn rags. " )
( train_assamesemale_01916 " discarded colour bags of potato chips and cornflower. " )
( train_assamesemale_01917 " a toy shanty in front of their own jhuggi. " )
( train_assamesemale_01918 " had he been really ill. " )
( train_assamesemale_01919 " he would simply have laid down. " )
( train_assamesemale_01920 " two days after jagua fell ill. " )
( train_assamesemale_01921 " the day after he erected his toy shanty. " )
( train_assamesemale_01922 " mina went to the market. " )
( train_assamesemale_01923 " strangely enough she felt no urge to go. " )
( train_assamesemale_01924 " she felt as if she had felt behind her ailing baby. " )
( train_assamesemale_01925 " however she realized that she was exaggerating her feelings. " )
( train_assamesemale_01926 " therefore she grabbed the shopping bag and walked. " )
( train_assamesemale_01927 " she walked to the bus stand. " )
( train_assamesemale_01928 " a swing in her steps without even looking back at the lonely jagua. " )
( train_assamesemale_01929 " far away and it took three hours to come back. " )
( train_assamesemale_01930 " however she could not help darting an anxious glance towards jaguas. " )
( train_assamesemale_01931 " when she reached home. " )
( train_assamesemale_01932 " due to the unjust machinations of her employers. " )
( train_assamesemale_01933 " nevertheless they were wages means to a livelihood. " )
( train_assamesemale_01934 " the mother could never sacrifice a days. " )
( train_assamesemale_01935 " simply in order to provide her son with love and care. " )
( train_assamesemale_01936 " that must be the way things had . " )
( train_assamesemale_01937 " the lonely boy had got bored stiff keeping himself company. " )
( train_assamesemale_01938 " jagua had decorated with the multi coloured brochures. " )
( train_assamesemale_01939 " mina had disdainfully discarded. " )
( train_assamesemale_01940 " he himself had carefully preserve. " )
( train_assamesemale_01941 " giving the onlooker the illusion. " )
( train_assamesemale_01942 " delhi had brilliantly deck up this hell. " )
( train_assamesemale_01943 " mina gazed at the scene without moving for a while. " )
( train_assamesemale_01944 " signing deeply to express her ennui. " )
( train_assamesemale_01945 " when is the stupid garage going to give up our car. " )
( train_assamesemale_01946 " i am really fed up. " )
( train_assamesemale_01947 " these last few days have seemed like ages. " )
( train_assamesemale_01948 " will we ever escape this graveyard and visit some human habitation again. " )
( train_assamesemale_01949 " i have my doubts vandanas husband tarak listen to these laments. " )
( train_assamesemale_01950 " puffed his in silence for sometimes. " )
( train_assamesemale_01951 " then he said why dont you go visiting someone in the campus. " )
( train_assamesemale_01952 " this suggestion provoked a grimace of disgust from vandana. " )
( train_assamesemale_01953 " i have been doing these last ten days. " )
( train_assamesemale_01954 " how many of your colleagues are marry. " )
( train_assamesemale_01955 " i can grace their homes with my visits. " )
( train_assamesemale_01956 " there are just four households in the entire campus with married couples. " )
( train_assamesemale_01957 " can i keep repeating my visits to these four houses. " )
( train_assamesemale_01958 " this time tarak was effectively. " )
( train_assamesemale_01959 " there were only a few homes in the campus. " )
( train_assamesemale_01960 " this engineering college had been established. " )
( train_assamesemale_01961 " all the engineers employed in it were young men. " )
( train_assamesemale_01962 " thus the vast was rather sparsely . " )
( train_assamesemale_01963 " it was yet to echo to the chatter of women. " )
( train_assamesemale_01964 " the cries of children. " )
( train_assamesemale_01965 " tarak himself had been married for only a year. " )
( train_assamesemale_01966 " his wife vandana was a city girl. " )
( train_assamesemale_01967 " she had been reared in the din and bustle of a glamorous city. " )
( train_assamesemale_01968 " she felt as if she had been planted in a graveyard. " )
( train_assamesemale_01969 " the place was at a distance of four miles from the city. " )
( train_assamesemale_01970 " the grounds owned by the college were immense. " )
( train_assamesemale_01971 " the campus was fringed on its four sides by hills. " )
( train_assamesemale_01972 " a vast pasture a metalled road that led to the city. " )
( train_assamesemale_01973 " a dimly seen hamlet with thick groves of bamboo. " )
( train_assamesemale_01974 " often vandana was bored to destruction. " )
( train_assamesemale_01975 " was such a god forsaken place fit for human habitation. " )
( train_assamesemale_01976 " she was however widely regarded as lucky. " )
( train_assamesemale_01977 " in netting such a prize catch of a foreign. " )
( train_assamesemale_01978 " return groom considering her modest. " )
( train_assamesemale_01979 " she herself was quite elated. " )
( train_assamesemale_01980 " on first hearing of the match. " )
( train_assamesemale_01981 " with its promise of the accompanying social . " )
( train_assamesemale_01982 " but the snobbish gratification faded out quickly. " )
( train_assamesemale_01983 " the fellowship of human beings. " )
( train_assamesemale_01984 " she had comforts enough in her new home. " )
( train_assamesemale_01985 " but she missed the gaiety of the boisterious city life of her past. " )
( train_assamesemale_01986 " did go to the city quite frequently. " )
( train_assamesemale_01987 " tarak had a car but for some days. " )
( train_assamesemale_01988 " now it was lying in a garage making life. " )
( train_assamesemale_01989 " a temporary tragedy for vandana. " )
( train_assamesemale_01990 " after that little exchange of talk. " )
( train_assamesemale_01991 " both of them lapse into silence. " )
( train_assamesemale_01992 " tarak lit another cigarette and vandana. " )
( train_assamesemale_01993 " relaxing in an easy chair. " )
( train_assamesemale_01994 " gazed at the street in front of them. " )
( train_assamesemale_01995 " which was totally devoid of human beings. " )
( train_assamesemale_01996 " then suddenly breaking the silence. " )
( train_assamesemale_01997 " tarak enthusiastically proposed. " )
( train_assamesemale_01998 " lets go to that village. " )
( train_assamesemale_01999 " where we have been meaning to go all this time. " )
( train_assamesemale_02000 " although not exactly animated by the proposal. " )
( train_assamesemale_02001 " vandana had no objection. " )
( train_assamesemale_02002 " she had often urged her husband. " )
( train_assamesemale_02003 " accompany her to that small village on the periphery of the campus. " )
( train_assamesemale_02004 " for the city girl a rural habitual was a novelty. " )
( train_assamesemale_02005 " tarak himself was not averse to the idea. " )
( train_assamesemale_02006 " but the desire was till now not translated into practice. " )
( train_assamesemale_02007 " resolution was about to become reality. " )
( train_assamesemale_02008 " to protect herself against the . " )
( train_assamesemale_02009 " which had sprung up suddenly. " )
( train_assamesemale_02010 " vandana wrapped herself up in a shawl. " )
( train_assamesemale_02011 " no further decking up was necessary. " )
( train_assamesemale_02012 " in front of the dressing table. " )
( train_assamesemale_02013 " to kill the long and torpid afternoon hours. " )
( train_assamesemale_02014 " the sharp cool breeze brought out the gose pimples on their flesh. " )
( train_assamesemale_02015 " but at the same time the pleasing was sunshine. " )
( train_assamesemale_02016 " the sun shine afternoon greeted them. " )
( train_assamesemale_02017 " as they stepped out into the street. " )
( train_assamesemale_02018 " it was the month of march. " )
( train_assamesemale_02019 " torridity was yet to become a feature of the sun. " )
( train_assamesemale_02020 " it is beautiful vandana commented after sometime. " )
( train_assamesemale_02021 " are not springtime afternoons always enchanting. " )
( train_assamesemale_02022 " the enjoyment of such evening is great. " )
( train_assamesemale_02023 " usually barred to people like us. " )
( train_assamesemale_02024 " we wont step down from our cars. " )
( train_assamesemale_02025 " the woman who was complaining. " )
( train_assamesemale_02026 " the non availability of a car. " )
( train_assamesemale_02027 " a little while ago. " )
( train_assamesemale_02028 " now say becoming rather poetic. " )
( train_assamesemale_02029 " that is only too true. " )
( train_assamesemale_02030 " if you want to drink in the beauty of nature. " )
( train_assamesemale_02031 " you must shun your cars for a while. " )
( train_assamesemale_02032 " how the grass we are treading is flooded. " )
( train_assamesemale_02033 " with the crimson rays of the sun. " )
( train_assamesemale_02034 " how these same rays have suffused. " )
( train_assamesemale_02035 " those floating clouds with their richness of red. " )
( train_assamesemale_02036 " and see those storks flying away into infinity. " )
( train_assamesemale_02037 " how could we even participate in this theatre. " )
( train_assamesemale_02038 " we remained coped up in our homes or in our cars. " )
( train_assamesemale_02039 " we had already reached the village. " )
( train_assamesemale_02040 " it really all that near. " )
( train_assamesemale_02041 " vandana broke off her rhapsody rather abruptly. " )
( train_assamesemale_02042 " find yourself already on the periphery of the village. " )
( train_assamesemale_02043 " what made you think it was far. " )
( train_assamesemale_02044 " this retort elicited a regretful exclamation from vandana. " )
( train_assamesemale_02045 " so near and yet for us. " )
( train_assamesemale_02046 " however even at that moment. " )
( train_assamesemale_02047 " they had not actually entered the village. " )
( train_assamesemale_02048 " they were still walking. " )
( train_assamesemale_02049 " the bamboo lined alley. " )
( train_assamesemale_02050 " that led to the village. " )
( train_assamesemale_02051 " though that realm of green darkness. " )
( train_assamesemale_02052 " created by the lofty bamboo poles. " )
( train_assamesemale_02053 " vandana suddenly felt. " )
( train_assamesemale_02054 " as if she had entered the wonderland. " )
( train_assamesemale_02055 " the nightingale ode by keats. " )
( train_assamesemale_02056 " which she had studied. " )
( train_assamesemale_02057 " in college came flitting to her mine. " )
( train_assamesemale_02058 " rather appropriately in that enchanted atmosphere. " )
( train_assamesemale_02059 " at that moment she did not feel. " )
( train_assamesemale_02060 " like sharing keats with tarak. " )
( train_assamesemale_02061 " for a busy engineer tarak read a lot of poetry. " )
( train_assamesemale_02062 " doubtless included keats. " )
( train_assamesemale_02063 " but the beguiling gloom had cast. " )
( train_assamesemale_02064 " such a spell on her that she felt. " )
( train_assamesemale_02065 " reluctant to break it. " )
( train_assamesemale_02066 " the strange journey through the shaded bamboo. " )
( train_assamesemale_02067 " lined avenue did not go on forever. " )
( train_assamesemale_02068 " they soon emerged out into the open. " )
( train_assamesemale_02069 " confronted a small meadow. " )
( train_assamesemale_02070 " a small and tortorous path and a cluster of mud huts. " )
( train_assamesemale_02071 " they realized that now. " )
( train_assamesemale_02072 " they were in the village proper. " )
( train_assamesemale_02073 " after the bout of prolong silence. " )
( train_assamesemale_02074 " tarak turned to his wife. " )
( train_assamesemale_02075 " he ask with a slight smile. " )
( train_assamesemale_02076 " a penny for your thoughts. " )
( train_assamesemale_02077 " at this query vandana gave a small start. " )
( train_assamesemale_02078 " she had been totally immersed. " )
( train_assamesemale_02079 " in the poetry of green around her. " )
( train_assamesemale_02080 " her husbands voice brought her out. " )
( train_assamesemale_02081 " her reverie with a jolt. " )
( train_assamesemale_02082 " everything seemed transformed. " )
( train_assamesemale_02083 " in vandanas eyes in this village. " )
( train_assamesemale_02084 " gourds climbing over the roof of a house. " )
( train_assamesemale_02085 " pigeon nestling on the same roof. " )
( train_assamesemale_02086 " a rather commonplace flower. " )
( train_assamesemale_02087 " which seemed to proudly give off an exotic fragrance. " )
( train_assamesemale_02088 " everything seemed to catch her fancy. " )
( train_assamesemale_02089 " she enthusiastically commented on all. " )
( train_assamesemale_02090 " while talking they had not ceased their ambling. " )
( train_assamesemale_02091 " after a while they reached a spot. " )
( train_assamesemale_02092 " where the road forked. " )
( train_assamesemale_02093 " one of the two paths which branched off. " )
( train_assamesemale_02094 " in different directions seemed. " )
( train_assamesemale_02095 " overgrown with shrubbery. " )
( train_assamesemale_02096 " the other seemed. " )
( train_assamesemale_02097 " lead to the popular parts of the village. " )
( train_assamesemale_02098 " tarak halted which way now. " )
( train_assamesemale_02099 " i dont feel like meeting people. " )
( train_assamesemale_02100 " so lets follow this smaller uptroden path. " )
( train_assamesemale_02101 " again they entered the land of green darkness. " )
( train_assamesemale_02102 " the narrow serpentine pathway was fringed. " )
( train_assamesemale_02103 " its two sides by briars and a host of wild nameless plants. " )
( train_assamesemale_02104 " but the delights that their excursion had to offer. " )
( train_assamesemale_02105 " they had not been exhausted. " )
( train_assamesemale_02106 " the path traversing ended abruptly. " )
( train_assamesemale_02107 " the jungle growth and the bamboo trees. " )
( train_assamesemale_02108 " when they emerged into a clearing. " )
( train_assamesemale_02109 " they were suddenly greeted by the spectacle of a silvery rivulet. " )
( train_assamesemale_02110 " behind the horizon. " )
( train_assamesemale_02111 " still its last feeble rays. " )
( train_assamesemale_02112 " finding here no leaves to dance on. " )
( train_assamesemale_02113 " now trod the waves of the stream instead. " )
( train_assamesemale_02114 " and suffused with the grace of the sunlight. " )
( train_assamesemale_02115 " the brook also bubbled on merrily. " )
( train_assamesemale_02116 " the counterpart of the forest. " )
( train_assamesemale_02117 " other side of the river was a sprawling pasture. " )
( train_assamesemale_02118 " mainly comprising a sandy bank and a paddy field. " )
( train_assamesemale_02119 " on those sands a few wild leafy plants. " )
( train_assamesemale_02120 " blushing scarlet with the all but extinguished rays. " )
( train_assamesemale_02121 " the sun were swaying gently in the breeze. " )
( train_assamesemale_02122 " a group of young women were slowly. " )
( train_assamesemale_02123 " wending their way homeward. " )
( train_assamesemale_02124 " after filling their pitchers with water from the river. " )
( train_assamesemale_02125 " the wild breeze rustled the leaves. " )
( train_assamesemale_02126 " the unknown bird intermittently cried out. " )
( train_assamesemale_02127 " to betoken its presence. " )
( train_assamesemale_02128 " these occasional breaks rather emphasized the solemn. " )
( train_assamesemale_02129 " almost sepulchral afternoon silence. " )
( train_assamesemale_02130 " vandana exclaimed suddenly how lovely. " )
( train_assamesemale_02131 " instantly the great silence disintegrated. " )
( train_assamesemale_02132 " all this time tarak had not vandana. " )
( train_assamesemale_02133 " but at her rapturous cry he turned towards her. " )
( train_assamesemale_02134 " he was startled. " )
( train_assamesemale_02135 " a strange beauty had transfigured her face. " )
( train_assamesemale_02136 " the sight of which somehow wrenched at his heart. " )
( train_assamesemale_02137 " but why this pensiveness. " )
( train_assamesemale_02138 " and was not this beauty. " )
( train_assamesemale_02139 " he saw on her face his to savour. " )
( train_assamesemale_02140 " a deep sigh broke from tarak. " )
( train_assamesemale_02141 " a small voice inside him said. " )
( train_assamesemale_02142 " while this beauty of vandana was not beyond him. " )
( train_assamesemale_02143 " now it was transient. " )
( train_assamesemale_02144 " this transfiguring beauty. " )
( train_assamesemale_02145 " and it was already fleeting. " )
( train_assamesemale_02146 " a few moments from now darkness. " )
( train_assamesemale_02147 " it would descend on everything. " )
( train_assamesemale_02148 " that darkness would throw. " )
( train_assamesemale_02149 " a velvety veil over vandanas face. " )
( train_assamesemale_02150 " on the face of the vandana. " )
( train_assamesemale_02151 " whom he would see at home. " )
( train_assamesemale_02152 " there would be no traces. " )
( train_assamesemale_02153 " the nameless emotions inspired by a magical twilight. " )
( train_assamesemale_02154 " on the banks of a lonely river. " )
( train_assamesemale_02155 " the mundane realities of household chores. " )
( train_assamesemale_02156 " ruthlessly obliterate that beauty. " )
( train_assamesemale_02157 " however on some other afternoon perhaps even tomorrow. " )
( train_assamesemale_02158 " the two of them again make. " )
( train_assamesemale_02159 " their pilgrimage to the bank of that haunting river. " )
( train_assamesemale_02160 " the circumstances retain their power to bring the same glow. " )
( train_assamesemale_02161 " wonder and rapture to vandanas face. " )
( train_assamesemale_02162 " the days would roll by and their daily trip. " )
( train_assamesemale_02163 " in quest of beauty would simply harden into a habit. " )
( train_assamesemale_02164 " one day they would discover. " )
( train_assamesemale_02165 " the bunch of flowers responsible for purifying the filthy water. " )
( train_assamesemale_02166 " the impure water responsible for taining the freshness of the flower. " )
( train_assamesemale_02167 " you can look both way you are right. " )
( train_assamesemale_02168 " actually is the way we look at things that matters. " )
( train_assamesemale_02169 " how the visual inputs strike our nervous system. " )
( train_assamesemale_02170 " the interesting is how exactly psychology analyses the situation. " )
( train_assamesemale_02171 " in what and in what context. " )
( train_assamesemale_02172 " the contaminated water of this river into account. " )
( train_assamesemale_02173 " we are meeting after such a long time. " )
( train_assamesemale_02174 " dont you have anything else to ask me. " )
( train_assamesemale_02175 " dont you want to know about nandan about our marriage. " )

( train_assamesemale_02177 " if everything is fine between us. " )
( train_assamesemale_02178 " i presume everything must be fine. " )

( train_assamesemale_02180 " he live in the room just next to mine. " )
( train_assamesemale_02181 " you yearned for commitment for security in life. " )
( train_assamesemale_02182 " so i must everything must be fine. " )

( train_assamesemale_02946 " he gestures with his hands that he wants to rest for some time. " )
( train_assamesemale_02947 " he will drink a glass of water and then tell us all. " )

( train_assamesemale_02956 " if he should meet someone though nowadays nobody gives a job on a verbal request. " )
( train_assamesemale_02957 " if she wants he could try someone. " )
( train_assamesemale_02958 " because those old moral principles have no meaning today. " )
( train_assamesemale_02959 " they are mere words in a lexicon or just old relics in a museum. " )
( train_assamesemale_02960 " so it would be worthwhile if her uncle tries to do some such thing. " )
( train_assamesemale_02961 " or her fathers certificate of a freedom fighter could come of use. " )
( train_assamesemale_02962 " many people secure jobs through them some even borrow certificates for such purposes. " )

( train_assamesemale_03010 " uncle please tell me if it is true. " )
( train_assamesemale_03011 " please tell me where you have heard such thing. " )
( train_assamesemale_03012 " the heron replied i have heard the news from a wide astrologer. " )
( train_assamesemale_03013 " you see there is already not much water in the lake. " )
( train_assamesemale_03014 " the girl named preety picks up todays newspaper from the table. " )

( train_assamesemale_03083 " the lion has hidden himself inside that stronghold. " )
( train_assamesemale_03084 " the witless lion stood at the edge of the well. " )
( train_assamesemale_03085 " and saw his own reflection in the water below. " )
( train_assamesemale_03086 " he thought it to be the lion who had challenged him. " )

( train_assamesemale_03102 " they believed heron as he was not trying to catch any fish at all. " )
( train_assamesemale_03103 " so they met the heron to seek advice. " )
( train_assamesemale_03104 " please guide us to save us from this disaster. " )
( train_assamesemale_03105 " the heron said there is indeed a lake not far from here. " )

( train_assamesemale_03113 " everyday he would carry on of them on his back. " )
( train_assamesemale_03114 " pretending to take them to the other lake. " )
( train_assamesemale_03115 " after flying a little away from the lake. " )
( train_assamesemale_03116 " he would smash them against a rock and eat them up. " )
( train_assamesemale_03117 " then return after some time to the lake. " )
( train_assamesemale_03118 " and relate false messages. " )
( train_assamesemale_03119 " how they are happy in the other lake. " )
( train_assamesemale_03120 " this happened for many days when the crab said to the heron. " )
( train_assamesemale_03121 " uncle you take others to the lake but it is me. " )
( train_assamesemale_03122 " please take me to the other lake to save my life. " )
( train_assamesemale_03123 " the heron was happy to hear this he thought to himself. " )
( train_assamesemale_03124 " having a fish everyday has become monotonous. " )
( train_assamesemale_03125 " i will get to eat a crab today for a change. " )
( train_assamesemale_03126 " the heron started carrying the crab to the same rock. " )
( train_assamesemale_03127 " the crab looked down from above. " )
( train_assamesemale_03128 " and saw the heap of bones and skeletons. " )
( train_assamesemale_03129 " at once the crab understood what the heron was up to. " )
( train_assamesemale_03130 " he remained calm and said to the heron. " )
( train_assamesemale_03131 " uncle the lake seems far and i am quite heavy. " )
( train_assamesemale_03132 " you must be getting tired let us stop for some rest. " )
( train_assamesemale_03133 " the heroin was confident that. " )

( train_assamesemale_03135 " the heron replied there is no lake for . " )
( train_assamesemale_03136 " this trip is for my as i do everyday. " )
( train_assamesemale_03137 " i will smash you against a rock and make a meal out of you. " )
( train_assamesemale_03138 " when the heron confessed the truth. " )
( train_assamesemale_03139 " the crab got hold of the herons neck. " )
( train_assamesemale_03140 " with its strong claws and strangled him to death. " )

( train_assamesemale_03145 " they were surprised to see him back. " )
( train_assamesemale_03146 " in this way you will not have to hunt. " )
( train_assamesemale_03147 " and many of our lives will be spared. " )
( train_assamesemale_03148 " hearing this the lion agreed. " )
( train_assamesemale_03149 " it is true but i warn you. " )
( train_assamesemale_03150 " if i donot receive an animal everyday. " )
( train_assamesemale_03151 " i shall processed to kill every one of you. " )
( train_assamesemale_03152 " in accordance to the understanding the animals drew lots. " )
( train_assamesemale_03153 " the unlucky animal who got chosen was sent to the lion. " )
( train_assamesemale_03154 " the others roamed about the jungle. " )
( train_assamesemale_03155 " without any fear of being attacked by the lion. " )
( train_assamesemale_03156 " one day a hare was chosen. " )
( train_assamesemale_03157 " unwilling to become the lions food. " )
( train_assamesemale_03158 " he started for the lions den. " )
( train_assamesemale_03159 " he walked as slow as possible. " )
( train_assamesemale_03160 " on the way the hare came across a well. " )
( train_assamesemale_03161 " it peeked down from the edge. " )
( train_assamesemale_03162 " and when it saw its own reflection he hit upon a plan. " )
( train_assamesemale_03163 " he taught i have a plan that will not fail. " )
( train_assamesemale_03164 " i will deceive the lion and lead him to his death. " )
( train_assamesemale_03165 " on this the hare walked towards the lions den. " )
( train_assamesemale_03166 " and even slower than before. " )
( train_assamesemale_03167 " finally when hare reached the lions den. " )
( train_assamesemale_03168 " the lion was hungry and furious. " )
( train_assamesemale_03169 " he had been waiting for his food for the entire day. " )
( train_assamesemale_03170 " he licked his lips in hunger and thought of killing. " )
( train_assamesemale_03171 " as many animals the next morning as he could. " )
( train_assamesemale_03172 " while he was thinking so the hare approached the lion. " )
( train_assamesemale_03173 " the furious lion began to shout you are a miserable animal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03174 " you are not only late but also very small. " )
( train_assamesemale_03175 " i will first kill you and satisfy my hunger. " )
( train_assamesemale_03176 " then kill all the rest of the animals for doing this to me. " )
( train_assamesemale_03177 " the hare replied humbly master. " )
( train_assamesemale_03178 " it is neither my fault nor the fault of any other animal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03179 " please allow me to explain before you kill me. " )
( train_assamesemale_03180 " give me an explanation fast for i am very hungry. " )
( train_assamesemale_03181 " the hare started it was my turn to be offered to you. " )
( train_assamesemale_03182 " but because i am small and would not be able to satisfy. " )
( train_assamesemale_03183 " your hunger four more hares were sent along with me. " )
( train_assamesemale_03184 " on the way we met a lion who came out of his den. " )
( train_assamesemale_03185 " we pleaded to him that we were going to full fill. " )
( train_assamesemale_03186 " mandavisarpini was a white flea. " )
( train_assamesemale_03187 " she lived in the folds of the exquisite white silk sheet. " )
( train_assamesemale_03188 " that covered the bed of a king in a certain country. " )
( train_assamesemale_03189 " she fed on the kings blood without anybody noticing. " )
( train_assamesemale_03190 " and was happy to spend her days. " )
( train_assamesemale_03191 " one day a bug managed to enter the beautifully decorated. " )
( train_assamesemale_03192 " the bedroom of the king. " )
( train_assamesemale_03193 " when the flea saw him she warned. " )
( train_assamesemale_03194 " what are you doing in the kings bedroom. " )
( train_assamesemale_03195 " leave at once before you get caught. " )
( train_assamesemale_03196 " that is no way to treat a guest. " )
( train_assamesemale_03197 " one should welcome a guest with humble words sweet behaviour. " )
( train_assamesemale_03198 " and one should offer refreshments. " )
( train_assamesemale_03199 " the bug continued i have fed myself. " )
( train_assamesemale_03200 " with all types of blood. " )
( train_assamesemale_03201 " but never have i had the pleasure of the blood of a king. " )
( train_assamesemale_03202 " it must be very sweet for the king eats. " )
( train_assamesemale_03203 " i would love to taste if you permit. " )
( train_assamesemale_03204 " the flea was taken aback. " )
( train_assamesemale_03205 " you have a nasty bite like a sharp needle. " )
( train_assamesemale_03206 " besides i on the kings blood only. " )
( train_assamesemale_03207 " when he is deep into his sleep. " )
( train_assamesemale_03208 " if you promised to wait till he is asleep. " )
( train_assamesemale_03209 " the bug agreed i promise to wait. " )
( train_assamesemale_03210 " till the king asleep. " )
( train_assamesemale_03211 " only after you yourself. " )
( train_assamesemale_03212 " i will feed myself on his blood. " )
( train_assamesemale_03213 " soon after they decided on such terms. " )
( train_assamesemale_03214 " the king came to his bedroom and lay down to sleep. " )
( train_assamesemale_03215 " the bug could not control himself. " )
( train_assamesemale_03216 " they decided to take a tiny bite of the king without waiting. " )
( train_assamesemale_03217 " as the king was yet to fall asleep. " )
( train_assamesemale_03218 " he jumped at the sharp bite of the bug. " )
( train_assamesemale_03219 " the king shouted at his servants. " )
( train_assamesemale_03220 " there is something in my bed that has bitten me. " )
( train_assamesemale_03221 " look for as i have already been bitten. " )
( train_assamesemale_03222 " on hearing this the bug quickly hid himself in a corner. " )
( train_assamesemale_03223 " the bed before the servants could start searching for him. " )
( train_assamesemale_03224 " however the servants scrutinized the entire bed sheet by sheet. " )
( train_assamesemale_03225 " and found the flea between the folds. " )
( train_assamesemale_03226 " they killed her at once and the king went to sleep. " )
( train_assamesemale_03227 " without any more worries. " )
( train_assamesemale_03228 " once a jackal named chandarava. " )
( train_assamesemale_03229 " one day he was very hungry and could not find any food. " )
( train_assamesemale_03230 " so he wandered into a nearby village in search of food. " )
( train_assamesemale_03231 " the dogs in the village saw the jackal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03232 " a group of dogs surrounded him barking. " )
( train_assamesemale_03233 " and attacking with their sharp teeth. " )
( train_assamesemale_03234 " the jackal started running to save itself but the dogs chased. " )
( train_assamesemale_03235 " in an attempt to flee from the dogs he ran into a house. " )
( train_assamesemale_03236 " there was a big vat of blue dye inside. " )
( train_assamesemale_03237 " as he jumped without knowing. " )
( train_assamesemale_03238 " his entire body was dyed in blue colour. " )
( train_assamesemale_03239 " he no longer looked like a jackal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03240 " frustrated he came out. " )
( train_assamesemale_03241 " when the dogs saw him again. " )
( train_assamesemale_03242 " they were unable to recognize him anymore. " )
( train_assamesemale_03243 " fearing that it was an unknown animal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03244 " they became terrified and ran off in all directions. " )
( train_assamesemale_03245 " the disappointed jackal went back to the jungle. " )
( train_assamesemale_03246 " but the blue dye would not come off. " )
( train_assamesemale_03247 " when the other animals in the jungle saw this blue coloured jackal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03248 " they ran away in terror. " )
( train_assamesemale_03249 " they said to themselves this is an unknown animal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03250 " and we do not know the strength of this new animal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03251 " it is better to run away. " )
( train_assamesemale_03252 " when the jackal realized that all the animals were running away. " )
( train_assamesemale_03253 " he called back at the frightened animals and said hey animals. " )
( train_assamesemale_03254 " why are you running away dont be afraid. " )
( train_assamesemale_03255 " brahma the lord of all creations has made me himself. " )
( train_assamesemale_03256 " brahma said to me the animals in the jungle do not have a proper king. " )
( train_assamesemale_03257 " go to the jungle and protect the animals. " )
( train_assamesemale_03258 " that is the reason i have come here he continued. " )
( train_assamesemale_03259 " come and live in peace in my kingdom and under my protection. " )
( train_assamesemale_03260 " the other animals were convinced and they surrounded him. " )
( train_assamesemale_03261 " as his subjects and we await your commands. " )
( train_assamesemale_03262 " please let us know whatever you want. " )
( train_assamesemale_03263 " the blue jackal assigned specific responsibilities to every animal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03264 " they were mostly on how to serve him. " )
( train_assamesemale_03265 " but he did not have anything to do with the other jackals. " )
( train_assamesemale_03266 " and did not want to come near them in fear of being recognized. " )
( train_assamesemale_03267 " so the jackals of the jungle were chased away. " )
( train_assamesemale_03268 " and so it went while the smaller animals would serve him. " )
( train_assamesemale_03269 " with his other needs the lions and the tigers would go out. " )
( train_assamesemale_03270 " to hunt for prey and place them before the jackal everyday. " )
( train_assamesemale_03271 " he would then distribute the food amongst other animals and himself. " )
( train_assamesemale_03272 " in this manner he discharged his royal duties. " )
( train_assamesemale_03273 " for all the animals under his kingdom. " )
( train_assamesemale_03274 " quite some time elapsed in this way. " )
( train_assamesemale_03275 " and there was peace between animals. " )
( train_assamesemale_03276 " one evening the blue jackal heard. " )
( train_assamesemale_03277 " a pack of jackals howling at a distance. " )
( train_assamesemale_03278 " unable to overcome his natural instinct. " )
( train_assamesemale_03279 " he was so spellbound that he was filled with tears of joy. " )
( train_assamesemale_03280 " he immediately sat up and began to howl like every other jackal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03281 " when the lion and the other animals heard this they realized. " )
( train_assamesemale_03282 " and how they have been fooled all the time. " )
( train_assamesemale_03283 " they held their heads down in shame but only for a moment. " )
( train_assamesemale_03284 " because they became very angry on the jackal for fooling them. " )
( train_assamesemale_03285 " they angrily said to each other this jackal has fooled us. " )
( train_assamesemale_03286 " we will not let him live anymore. " )
( train_assamesemale_03287 " he should be punished. " )
( train_assamesemale_03288 " when they jackal realized he tried to flee from them. " )
( train_assamesemale_03289 " but the animals got hold of him and he was torn into pieces. " )
( train_assamesemale_03290 " he died on the very spot. " )
( train_assamesemale_03291 " there was once a jungle that was ruled by a lion. " )
( train_assamesemale_03292 " who had a leopard jackal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03293 " and a crow at his service along with other animals. " )
( train_assamesemale_03294 " as they did regularly they were wandering about the jungle. " )
( train_assamesemale_03295 " one day when the lion saw a camel at a distance. " )
( train_assamesemale_03296 " and was feeding itself on the green grass of the jungle. " )
( train_assamesemale_03297 " the lion took a fancy on this animal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03298 " he had not seen before let us go. " )
( train_assamesemale_03299 " and ask this extraordinary animal where he comes from. " )
( train_assamesemale_03300 " the crow who flies to far off places was aware. " )
( train_assamesemale_03301 " it is camel and this animal lives in villages. " )
( train_assamesemale_03302 " the flesh of this animal tastes good. " )
( train_assamesemale_03303 " let us kill it and eat it but the lion disagreed. " )
( train_assamesemale_03304 " he does not belong to the jungle so he is our guest. " )
( train_assamesemale_03305 " i will not kill it please go and assure him. " )
( train_assamesemale_03306 " that no harm will be done and bring him to me. " )
( train_assamesemale_03307 " as per the lions instruction they went to the camel. " )
( train_assamesemale_03308 " and assured him that they were to bring it to the lion. " )
( train_assamesemale_03309 " they won its confidence and they brought the camel to the lion. " )
( train_assamesemale_03310 " the camel stood before the lion and bowed. " )
( train_assamesemale_03311 " and how he had reached the jungle. " )
( train_assamesemale_03312 " on hearing this the lion said. " )
( train_assamesemale_03313 " he will be made a beast to carry burden again. " )
( train_assamesemale_03314 " stay in the jungle under my kingdom instead you can feast. " )
( train_assamesemale_03315 " on the abundant green grass of the jungle any fear. " )
( train_assamesemale_03316 " the camel accepted the offer. " )
( train_assamesemale_03317 " and they began to live together in peace. " )
( train_assamesemale_03318 " later one day the lion got severely wounded. " )
( train_assamesemale_03319 " in a fight with a mad elephant. " )
( train_assamesemale_03320 " such were his injuries that he could not take a few steps. " )
( train_assamesemale_03321 " due to lack of food the lion became weaker. " )
( train_assamesemale_03322 " the animals who served him were also starving. " )
( train_assamesemale_03323 " since they were dependent on the lion for their food. " )
( train_assamesemale_03324 " when the lion could not bear anymore he called them. " )
( train_assamesemale_03325 " and said go and find any animal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03326 " that i can prey upon even in my weak condition. " )
( train_assamesemale_03327 " this way i can provide food for you and also for myself. " )
( train_assamesemale_03328 " all the animals wandered about the jungle. " )
( train_assamesemale_03329 " without any success to find such an animal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03330 " on their way back the jackal had a plan. " )
( train_assamesemale_03331 " he said to the crow there is no point wandering about the jungle. " )
( train_assamesemale_03332 " when the food is right in front of us. " )
( train_assamesemale_03333 " the camel can provide us with the food. " )
( train_assamesemale_03334 " for all of us for a long time. " )
( train_assamesemale_03335 " the crow replied indeed what you say is correct. " )
( train_assamesemale_03336 " but has assured the camel of his safety under his rule. " )
( train_assamesemale_03337 " he will refuse to kill him. " )
( train_assamesemale_03338 " the jackal said leave that to me. " )
( train_assamesemale_03339 " that he will agree to feast on the camel. " )
( train_assamesemale_03340 " you wait till i return after a discussion with the lion. " )
( train_assamesemale_03341 " the jackal met the lion and said master. " )
( train_assamesemale_03342 " we have been looking all around the jungle. " )

( train_assamesemale_03465 " the strongest opponents if they are zealous. " )
( train_assamesemale_03466 " And so I plan to dry up the whole sea. " )
( train_assamesemale_03467 " by sucking its water with my beak. " )
( train_assamesemale_03468 " The wife argued How can you suck the sea dry. " )
( train_assamesemale_03469 " when rivers like the Ganges and Indus. " )

( train_assamesemale_03471 " There is no good in this babbling. " )

( train_assamesemale_03474 " which is as solid as iron. " )
( train_assamesemale_03475 " Man can succeed only after putting efforts. " )

( train_assamesemale_03482 " I will do this with the help of my friends. " )
( train_assamesemale_03483 " Now all the friends of the female Tittibha bird were called. " )
( train_assamesemale_03484 " and when they all gathered together. " )
( train_assamesemale_03485 " the male Tittibha bird explained his problem with the sea. " )

( train_assamesemale_03488 " All the birds the swan crane peacock and other unanimously agreed. " )
( train_assamesemale_03489 " the task was impossible There is no good in this babbling. " )
( train_assamesemale_03490 " It is impossible for us to suck the sea to dry it up completely. " )
( train_assamesemale_03491 " Instead let us visit our king Garuda Lord Vishnus vehicle. " )
( train_assamesemale_03492 " the king of birds according to Hindu mythology. " )
( train_assamesemale_03493 " When he comes to know that we have been harassed by the sea. " )
( train_assamesemale_03494 " he will get angry and seek revenge. " )
( train_assamesemale_03495 " Even if we merely pay him a visit to seek his advice. " )
( train_assamesemale_03496 " we shall feel relieved. " )
( train_assamesemale_03497 " As decided they all went to their king Garuda. " )
( train_assamesemale_03498 " explained the reason of them being so sad. " )
( train_assamesemale_03499 " O King the sea has robbed the eggs of the good Tittibha birds. " )
( train_assamesemale_03500 " even after the fact that you are our protector. " )
( train_assamesemale_03501 " If this is allowed to continue our entire race shall perish. " )
( train_assamesemale_03502 " Garuda realized that the birds were in grave circumstances. " )
( train_assamesemale_03503 " and agreed to go and dry the entire sea. " )
( train_assamesemale_03504 " Just as he was leaving a messenger arrived from Lord Vishnu. " )
( train_assamesemale_03505 " who needed his assistance at once for some divine task. " )
( train_assamesemale_03506 " Garuda explained to the messenger that he was unable to serve his master. " )
( train_assamesemale_03507 " at this time I am such a common servant. " )
( train_assamesemale_03508 " to the Lord for him to need me. " )
( train_assamesemale_03509 " The sea which is the resting place of the Lord has swallowed. " )

( train_assamesemale_03512 " to return the eggs at once This is my firm resolution. " )
( train_assamesemale_03513 " Please let him know of it. " )
( train_assamesemale_03514 " When Lord Vishnu came to know the Garudas resolution from his messenger. " )
( train_assamesemale_03515 " he thought I can understand his behaviour and need to pacify him. " )
( train_assamesemale_03516 " He is the king and protector of all the birds. " )
( train_assamesemale_03517 " I must meet Garuda at once. " )
( train_assamesemale_03518 " As Lord Vishnu visited Garuda he bowed in respect and explained. " )
( train_assamesemale_03519 " the sea which is your resting place has insulted me. " )
( train_assamesemale_03520 " by swallowing the eggs of my humble servant the good Tittibha birds. " )
( train_assamesemale_03521 " It is out of the respect that I have for you. " )
( train_assamesemale_03522 " I have not taken any step for revenge. " )
( train_assamesemale_03523 " Lord Vishnu considered his plea Come with me Garuda. " )
( train_assamesemale_03524 " You are right. " )
( train_assamesemale_03525 " The sea should not have done such a thing on purpose. " )
( train_assamesemale_03526 " Let us go and return the eggs to the Tittibha birds. " )
( train_assamesemale_03527 " After that we will leave as I need your assistance. " )
( train_assamesemale_03528 " They all went to the seashore where Lord Vishnu reprimanded the sea. " )
( train_assamesemale_03529 " Taking a thunderbolt in his hand he warned. " )
( train_assamesemale_03530 " O Sea you have been wicked. " )
( train_assamesemale_03531 " Return the eggs of the Tittibha birds. " )
( train_assamesemale_03532 " at once or dare to face my anger. " )
( train_assamesemale_03533 " When the sea heard the warning from the Lord Vishnu himself. " )
( train_assamesemale_03534 " it was terrified. " )
( train_assamesemale_03535 " It at once aplogised and returned the eggs to the Tittibha birds. " )
( train_assamesemale_03536 " What is destined to happen will happen for sure. " )
( train_assamesemale_03537 " The female sparrow replied That is indeed true. " )
( train_assamesemale_03538 " But all my children were killed by this wicked elephant. " )
( train_assamesemale_03539 " this is also true We had done no harm to him. " )
( train_assamesemale_03540 " If you consider yourself to be a friend continued the female sparrow. " )
( train_assamesemale_03541 " Please suggest me a way to destroy this elephant. " )
( train_assamesemale_03542 " and avenge the death of my children. " )
( train_assamesemale_03543 " So I will repie the woodpecker I have a fly as a friend. " )
( train_assamesemale_03544 " Let us go and ask for her help to destroy this cruel elephant. " )
( train_assamesemale_03545 " Thus the woodpecker and the female sparrow went to meet the fly. " )
( train_assamesemale_03546 " The woodpecker explained My friend please meet this sparrow. " )
( train_assamesemale_03547 " She is a dear friend of mine. " )
( train_assamesemale_03548 " Her eggs were destroyed by wicked elephant. " )
( train_assamesemale_03549 " please help us find a way to destroy this cruel elephant. " )
( train_assamesemale_03550 " I will certainly help you the fly said. " )
( train_assamesemale_03551 " after hering the events How can I be you friend. " )
( train_assamesemale_03552 " and yet not help you when you need me. " )
( train_assamesemale_03553 " I have a frog as a good friend. " )
( train_assamesemale_03554 " let us seek his help to destroy this wicked elephant. " )
( train_assamesemale_03555 " Thus the female sparrow woodpecker and the fly went to the frog. " )
( train_assamesemale_03556 " and explained him of all the events. " )
( train_assamesemale_03557 " for which they had come to him for help. " )
( train_assamesemale_03558 " The old frog said after hearing everything. " )
( train_assamesemale_03559 " The elephant is big but he is alone. " )
( train_assamesemale_03560 " What can this elephant do if we work together. " )
( train_assamesemale_03561 " to destroy him I have a plan. " )
( train_assamesemale_03562 " He explained Fly When the sun is scorching your task would be to buzz in his ears. " )
( train_assamesemale_03563 " When he closes his eyes in sheer ecstacy. " )
( train_assamesemale_03564 " the woodpeckers task would be to peck his eyes and make him blind. " )
( train_assamesemale_03565 " In this scorching summer he will certainly search for water. " )
( train_assamesemale_03566 " but being blinded already he will not be able to do so. " )
( train_assamesemale_03567 " I will then sit on the edge of the nearby pit. " )
( train_assamesemale_03568 " and cloak at the top of my voice. " )
( train_assamesemale_03569 " He continued When the thirsty elephant hears me. " )
( train_assamesemale_03570 " he will think there is a pond or lake nearby and follow my voice. " )
( train_assamesemale_03571 " And when he does so he will fall into the pit and perish. " )
( train_assamesemale_03572 " This way we can avenge the death of the sparrows children. " )
( train_assamesemale_03573 " The others agreed to the plan. " )
( train_assamesemale_03574 " and organized to do their part of the tasks as laid by the old frog. " )
( train_assamesemale_03575 " They executed their tasks successfully. " )
( train_assamesemale_03576 " and the elephant fell into a muddy pit to eventually die. " )
( train_assamesemale_03577 " There lived a lion called Vajradaunstra in the jungle. " )
( train_assamesemale_03578 " who had two attendents a jackal and a wolf. " )
( train_assamesemale_03579 " One day a caravan was passing by. " )
( train_assamesemale_03580 " one of the camels in the caravan was a expectant female. " )
( train_assamesemale_03581 " As she was not able to walk and was in labour pains. " )
( train_assamesemale_03582 " the caraven set her free and left her behind. " )
( train_assamesemale_03583 " Within moments she fell prey to the lion. " )
( train_assamesemale_03584 " and while the them were eating. " )
( train_assamesemale_03585 " They cut the womb of the camel. " )
( train_assamesemale_03586 " from which a baby camel came out. " )
( train_assamesemale_03587 " Since it was just a baby. " )
( train_assamesemale_03588 " and they already had a good meal out of the camel. " )
( train_assamesemale_03589 " the lion decided to spare the baby camels life. " )
( train_assamesemale_03590 " He brought the baby camel home. " )
( train_assamesemale_03591 " The lion said to the little camel. " )
( train_assamesemale_03592 " From now onwards you will live with us. " )
( train_assamesemale_03593 " and you will have nothing to fear from even me. " )
( train_assamesemale_03594 " I will let everybody know that you are under my protection. " )
( train_assamesemale_03595 " and you can wander about fearlessly and feed on the green grass of the jungle. " )
( train_assamesemale_03596 " From then onwards they lived happily. " )
( train_assamesemale_03597 " The four of them would tell each other stories. " )
( train_assamesemale_03598 " and the camel was already found along with the lion. " )
( train_assamesemale_03599 " One day the lion returned home badly injured. " )
( train_assamesemale_03600 " after a fight with a wild elephant. " )
( train_assamesemale_03601 " He was unable to even walk let alone go out and hunt. " )
( train_assamesemale_03602 " Unable to bear the hunger he asked the camel jackal and the wolf. " )
( train_assamesemale_03603 " to go in search of some small animal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03604 " that he will be able to kill even in his condition. " )
( train_assamesemale_03605 " Thus the hunger for all three of them would be satisfied. " )
( train_assamesemale_03606 " But the three of them returned emptyhanded in the evening. " )
( train_assamesemale_03607 " after their efforts to search for an animal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03608 " The jackal began wondering in hunger. " )
( train_assamesemale_03609 " The young camel does not belong amongst us. " )
( train_assamesemale_03610 " and he will be able to provide food for many days. " )
( train_assamesemale_03611 " But I have to be cunning to convince the lion to kill him. " )
( train_assamesemale_03612 " as he has promised not to harm him. " )
( train_assamesemale_03613 " He said to the camel Our master will soon die of hunger. " )
( train_assamesemale_03614 " and some other animal will prey on you after they know. " )
( train_assamesemale_03615 " there is nobody to protect you anymore. " )
( train_assamesemale_03616 " I suggest you must offer yourself to the lion and save us from dying. " )
( train_assamesemale_03617 " For your sacrifice you will be reborn in a body. " )
( train_assamesemale_03618 " twice the size of what you have in this life. " )
( train_assamesemale_03619 " The young camel agreed immediately. " )
( train_assamesemale_03620 " Had it not been for the lion I would have been death long ago. " )
( train_assamesemale_03621 " I shall be rewarded hundred times for my sacrifice and find a place in heaven. " )
( train_assamesemale_03622 " I agree to offer my body. " )
( train_assamesemale_03623 " In the evening the jackal said to the lion. " )
( train_assamesemale_03624 " that the camel will be blessed with twice the size of the body. " )
( train_assamesemale_03625 " in his next birth if he killed him and worshipped. " )
( train_assamesemale_03626 " God before eating him. " )
( train_assamesemale_03627 " He explained that the camel was willing to offer his body. " )
( train_assamesemale_03628 " The lion was convinced by the cunning jackal and he agreed. " )
( train_assamesemale_03629 " As soon the jackal was able to convince him. " )
( train_assamesemale_03630 " he jumped on the young camel and tore his apart. " )
( train_assamesemale_03631 " The young camel died instantly. " )
( train_assamesemale_03632 " The lion remembered that he must worship before eating. " )
( train_assamesemale_03633 " for the young camels next life and asked the jackal. " )
( train_assamesemale_03634 " and wolf to guard over the carcass while he returned. " )
( train_assamesemale_03635 " He then went for a bath and worshiped the gods. " )
( train_assamesemale_03636 " When the lion was gone the jackal thought. " )
( train_assamesemale_03637 " How can I fool the lion and have the entire camel for myself. " )
( train_assamesemale_03638 " He thought of a plan and called out to the wolf. " )
( train_assamesemale_03639 " I know you are unable to tolerate the hunger anymore. " )

( train_assamesemale_04241 " and she welcomed no haphazard visitor. " )
( train_assamesemale_04242 " Her hospitalities were as serious as her manner. " )
( train_assamesemale_04243 " one fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet. " )

( train_assamesemale_04252 " that she missed catching it as it fell. " )
( train_assamesemale_04253 " and the ball bounded away and rolled along on the ground. " )
( train_assamesemale_04254 " until at last it fell down into the spring. " )
( train_assamesemale_04255 " the princess looked into the spring. " )
( train_assamesemale_04256 " after her ball but it was very deep. " )
( train_assamesemale_04257 " so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. " )
( train_assamesemale_04258 " she began to cry and said if i could only get my ball again. " )
( train_assamesemale_04259 " i would give all my fine clothes and jewels. " )
( train_assamesemale_04260 " and everything that i have in the world. " )
( train_assamesemale_04261 " she was speaking a frog put its head out of the water. " )

( train_assamesemale_04266 " and jewels and fine clothes but if you will love me. " )
( train_assamesemale_04267 " and let me live with you and eat from off your golden plate. " )
( train_assamesemale_04268 " and sleep on your bed i will bring you your ball again. " )
( train_assamesemale_04269 " what nonsense thought the princess. " )
( train_assamesemale_04270 " this silly frog is talking. " )
( train_assamesemale_04271 " he can never even get out of the spring to visit me. " )
( train_assamesemale_04272 " though he may be able to get my ball for me. " )
( train_assamesemale_04273 " and therefore i will tell him. " )
( train_assamesemale_04274 " he shall have what he asks. " )
( train_assamesemale_04275 " so she said to the frog well. " )
( train_assamesemale_04276 " if you will bring me my ball. " )
( train_assamesemale_04277 " i will do all you ask. " )
( train_assamesemale_04278 " then the frog put his head down. " )
( train_assamesemale_04279 " and dived deep under the water. " )
( train_assamesemale_04280 " and after a little while he came up again. " )
( train_assamesemale_04281 " with the ball in his mouth and threw it. " )
( train_assamesemale_04282 " on the edge of the spring. " )
( train_assamesemale_04283 " as soon as the young princess saw her ball. " )
( train_assamesemale_04284 " she ran to pick it up. " )
( train_assamesemale_04285 " and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again. " )
( train_assamesemale_04286 " that she never thought of the frog but ran home. " )
( train_assamesemale_04287 " with it as fast as she could. " )
( train_assamesemale_04288 " the frog called after her stay princess. " )
( train_assamesemale_04289 " and take me with you as you said. " )
( train_assamesemale_04290 " but she did not stop to hear a word. " )
( train_assamesemale_04291 " the next day just as the princess had sat down to dinner. " )
( train_assamesemale_04292 " she heard a strange noise as if something was coming. " )
( train_assamesemale_04293 " up the marble staircase and soon afterwards. " )
( train_assamesemale_04294 " there was a gentle knock at the door. " )
( train_assamesemale_04295 " and a little voice cried out and said. " )
( train_assamesemale_04296 " open the door my princess dear. " )
( train_assamesemale_04297 " by the fountain cool in the greenwood shade. " )
( train_assamesemale_04298 " then the princess ran to the door and opened it. " )
( train_assamesemale_04299 " and there she saw the frog whom she had quite forgotten. " )
( train_assamesemale_04300 " at this sight she was sadly frightened. " )
( train_assamesemale_04301 " and shutting the door as fast as. " )
( train_assamesemale_04302 " she could came back to her seat. " )
( train_assamesemale_04303 " the king her father seeing that something had frightened her. " )
( train_assamesemale_04304 " asked her what was the matter. " )
( train_assamesemale_04305 " there is a nasty frog said she at the door. " )
( train_assamesemale_04306 " that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning. " )
( train_assamesemale_04307 " i told him that he should live with me here. " )
( train_assamesemale_04308 " thinking that he could never get out of the spring. " )
( train_assamesemale_04309 " but there he is at the door and he wants to come in. " )
( train_assamesemale_04310 " while she was speaking the frog knocked again. " )
( train_assamesemale_04311 " at the door and said open the door my princess dear. " )
( train_assamesemale_04312 " then the king said to the young princess. " )
( train_assamesemale_04313 " as you have given your word you must keep it. " )
( train_assamesemale_04314 " so go and let him in she did so. " )
( train_assamesemale_04315 " and the frog hopped into the room. " )
( train_assamesemale_04316 " the bottom of the room to the top. " )
( train_assamesemale_04317 " till he came up close to the table. " )
( train_assamesemale_04318 " where the princess sat pray lift me upon chair. " )
( train_assamesemale_04319 " said he to the princess and let me sit next to you. " )
( train_assamesemale_04320 " as soon as she had done this the frog said. " )
( train_assamesemale_04321 " put your plate nearer to me. " )
( train_assamesemale_04322 " that i may eat out of it. " )
( train_assamesemale_04323 " this she did and when he had eaten. " )
( train_assamesemale_04324 " as much as she could he said now i am tired. " )
( train_assamesemale_04325 " and the princess though very unwilling took him up. " )
( train_assamesemale_04326 " in her hand and put him upon the pillow of her own bed. " )
( train_assamesemale_04327 " where his slept all night long. " )
( train_assamesemale_04328 " as soon as it was light the frog jumped up. " )
( train_assamesemale_04329 " hopped downstairs and went out of the house. " )
( train_assamesemale_04330 " now then thought the princess at last he is gone. " )
( train_assamesemale_04331 " and i shall be troubled with him no more. " )
( train_assamesemale_04332 " but she was mistaken for when night came again. " )
( train_assamesemale_04333 " she heard the same tapping at the door. " )
( train_assamesemale_04334 " and the frog came once more and said. " )
( train_assamesemale_04335 " and when the princess opened the door. " )
( train_assamesemale_04336 " the frog came in and slept upon her pillow. " )
( train_assamesemale_04337 " as before till the morning broke. " )
( train_assamesemale_04338 " and the third night he did the same. " )
( train_assamesemale_04339 " but when the princess awoke on the following morning. " )
( train_assamesemale_04340 " she was astonished to see instead of the frog. " )
( train_assamesemale_04341 " a handsome prince gazing on her. " )
( train_assamesemale_04342 " with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen. " )
( train_assamesemale_04343 " and standing at the head of her bed. " )
( train_assamesemale_04344 " he told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04345 " who had changed him into a frog. " )
( train_assamesemale_04346 " and that he had been fated so to abide. " )
( train_assamesemale_04347 " till some princess should take him out of the spring. " )
( train_assamesemale_04348 " and let him eat from her plate. " )
( train_assamesemale_04349 " and sleep upon her bed for three nights. " )
( train_assamesemale_04350 " and said the prince have broken his cruel charm. " )
( train_assamesemale_04351 " and now i have nothing to wish for. " )
( train_assamesemale_04352 " but that you should go with me into my fathers kingdom. " )
( train_assamesemale_04353 " where i will marry you and love you as long as you live. " )
( train_assamesemale_04354 " the young princess you may be sure was not long. " )
( train_assamesemale_04355 " in saying yes to all this. " )
( train_assamesemale_04356 " and as they spoke a brightly coloured coach drove up. " )
( train_assamesemale_04357 " with eight beautiful horses decked. " )
( train_assamesemale_04358 " with of feathers and a golden harness. " )
( train_assamesemale_04359 " and behind the coach rode the princes servant. " )
( train_assamesemale_04360 " who had bewailed the misfortunes of his dear master. " )
( train_assamesemale_04361 " during his enchantment so long and so bitterly. " )
( train_assamesemale_04362 " they then took leave of the king. " )
( train_assamesemale_04363 " and got into the coach with eight horses. " )
( train_assamesemale_04364 " and all set out full of joy and merriment. " )
( train_assamesemale_04365 " and there they lived happily a great many years. " )
( train_assamesemale_04366 " she was always called the bad girl. " )
( train_assamesemale_04367 " for she had once when she was very little. " )
( train_assamesemale_04368 " put out her tongue at the postman. " )
( train_assamesemale_04369 " she lived along with her grandmother. " )
( train_assamesemale_04370 " and her three brothers in the cottage beyond the field. " )
( train_assamesemale_04371 " and the girls in the village took no notice of her. " )
( train_assamesemale_04372 " the bad girl did not mind this for. " )
( train_assamesemale_04373 " she was always thinking of the cuckoo clock. " )
( train_assamesemale_04374 " the clock stood in one corner in the cottage. " )
( train_assamesemale_04375 " and every hour a door opened at the top of its face. " )
( train_assamesemale_04376 " and a little cuckoo came out. " )
( train_assamesemale_04377 " and called its name just the same number of times. " )
( train_assamesemale_04378 " that the clock ought to have struck and called it. " )
( train_assamesemale_04379 " so loudly and in so much haste. " )
( train_assamesemale_04380 " that the clock was afraid to strike at all. " )
( train_assamesemale_04381 " the bad girl was always wondering whether it was worse. " )
( train_assamesemale_04382 " for the clock to have a cupboard in its forehead and a bird. " )
( train_assamesemale_04383 " that was always hopping in and out or for the poor cuckoo. " )
( train_assamesemale_04384 " to spend so much time in a dark little prison. " )
( train_assamesemale_04385 " if it could only get away to the woods. " )
( train_assamesemale_04386 " she said to herself who knows. " )
( train_assamesemale_04387 " but its voice might grow sweet. " )
( train_assamesemale_04388 " and even life itself might come to it. " )
( train_assamesemale_04389 " she thought of the clock so much. " )
( train_assamesemale_04390 " that her grandmother used to say. " )
( train_assamesemale_04391 " if you would only think of me sometimes. " )
( train_assamesemale_04392 " but the bad girl would answer. " )
( train_assamesemale_04393 " you are not in prison granny dear. " )
( train_assamesemale_04394 " and you have not even a bee in your bonnet. " )
( train_assamesemale_04395 " let alone a bird in your head. " )
( train_assamesemale_04396 " why should i think of you. " )
( train_assamesemale_04397 " one day close by the farm she saw the big girls. " )
( train_assamesemale_04398 " from the school gathering flowers. " )
( train_assamesemale_04399 " give me one she said perhaps the cuckoo would like it. " )
( train_assamesemale_04400 " but they all cried and tried to frighten her away. " )
( train_assamesemale_04401 " they are for the little ones birthday tomorrow. " )
( train_assamesemale_04402 " she will be seven years old they said. " )
( train_assamesemale_04403 " and she is to have a crown of flowers and a cake. " )
( train_assamesemale_04404 " and all the afternoon we shall play merry games. " )
( train_assamesemale_04405 " with her is she unhappy that you are taking. " )
( train_assamesemale_04406 " she is very happy but it will be her birthday. " )
( train_assamesemale_04407 " and we want to make her happier. " )
( train_assamesemale_04408 " why because we love her said one. " )
( train_assamesemale_04409 " because she is so little said another. " )
( train_assamesemale_04410 " because she is alive said a third are all things. " )
( train_assamesemale_04411 " that live to be loved and cared for. " )
( train_assamesemale_04412 " the bad girl asked but they were too busy to listen. " )
( train_assamesemale_04413 " so she went on her way thinking and it seemed. " )
( train_assamesemale_04414 " as if all things round the birds and bees. " )
( train_assamesemale_04415 " and the rustling leaves and the little tender wild flowers. " )
( train_assamesemale_04416 " half hidden in the grass answered as she went along. " )
( train_assamesemale_04417 " yes they are all to be cared for and made happier. " )
( train_assamesemale_04418 " if it be possible the cuckoo clock is not alive. " )
( train_assamesemale_04419 " she thought it is not alive the trees answered. " )
( train_assamesemale_04420 " but many things that do not live have voices. " )
( train_assamesemale_04421 " and many others are just sign posts pointing the way. " )
( train_assamesemale_04422 " the way to what and where we find out for ourselves. " )
( train_assamesemale_04423 " we must all find out for ourselves. " )
( train_assamesemale_04424 " the trees signed and whispered to each other. " )
( train_assamesemale_04425 " as the bad girl entered the cottage. " )
( train_assamesemale_04426 " the cuckoo called out its name eleven times. " )
( train_assamesemale_04427 " but she did not even look up. " )
( train_assamesemale_04428 " she walked straight across to the chair by the fireside. " )
( train_assamesemale_04429 " and kneeling down kissed her grannys hands. " )
( train_assamesemale_04430 " once upon a time there was a funny guy named lenny. " )
( train_assamesemale_04431 " lenny was an inventor he invented all kinds of contraptions. " )
( train_assamesemale_04432 " his house looked like a mess. " )
( train_assamesemale_04433 " but he had some really cool things. " )
( train_assamesemale_04434 " one day lenny decided he wanted to fly. " )
( train_assamesemale_04435 " i am going to invent some wings and fly. " )
( train_assamesemale_04436 " lenny told his friend rudy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04437 " now i really know you are crazy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04438 " you would not even get off the ground said rudy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04439 " you will see said lenny so he went down to his workshop. " )
( train_assamesemale_04440 " and began working day and night he worked. " )
( train_assamesemale_04441 " no one saw lenny for weeks. " )
( train_assamesemale_04442 " then one day he came out of his workshop. " )
( train_assamesemale_04443 " with a great big grin on his face. " )
( train_assamesemale_04444 " he called rudy on the phone rudy tomorrow. " )
( train_assamesemale_04445 " i will fly but i need your help said lenny. " )
( train_assamesemale_04446 " did you really build some wings asked rudy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04447 " they are really beautiful said lenny. " )
( train_assamesemale_04448 " they are a little heavy though i need you to help me. " )
( train_assamesemale_04449 " what did you make them out of asked rudy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04450 " i made them out of some scrap metal. " )
( train_assamesemale_04451 " i had laying around from when i built my helicopter. " )
( train_assamesemale_04452 " last year said lenny metal do not you think. " )
( train_assamesemale_04453 " they will be too heavy to use for wings asked rudy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04454 " no i calculated all of the angles. " )
( train_assamesemale_04455 " i will be like a human airplane said lenny. " )
( train_assamesemale_04456 " rudy just rolled his eyes. " )
( train_assamesemale_04457 " i will be over first thing in the morning. " )
( train_assamesemale_04458 " and well try them out said rudy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04459 " see you then said lenny. " )
( train_assamesemale_04460 " the next morning they dragged the wings. " )
( train_assamesemale_04461 " up to the top of kill devil hill. " )
( train_assamesemale_04462 " the lenny strapped them on. " )
( train_assamesemale_04463 " are you sure those are not too heavy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04464 " asked rudy again no the faster i run. " )
( train_assamesemale_04465 " the lighter they will get. " )
( train_assamesemale_04466 " the wind will lift me up. " )
( train_assamesemale_04467 " and i will be flying said lenny. " )
( train_assamesemale_04468 " quite confidently all right i am going. " )
( train_assamesemale_04469 " to get a running start and take off said lenny. " )
( train_assamesemale_04470 " so lenny backed up about fifty feet. " )
( train_assamesemale_04471 " and started running as he ran the weight of the wings. " )
( train_assamesemale_04472 " started to wear out his legs. " )
( train_assamesemale_04473 " and he got lower and lower to the ground. " )
( train_assamesemale_04474 " just as he got to the crest of the hill. " )
( train_assamesemale_04475 " his legs gave out. " )
( train_assamesemale_04476 " and he skidded across the ground on his face. " )
( train_assamesemale_04477 " after rudy rolled around on the ground. " )
( train_assamesemale_04478 " laughing for about a minute. " )
( train_assamesemale_04479 " he got up and asked lenny if he was ok. " )
( train_assamesemale_04480 " real funny said lenny i guess you may be right. " )
( train_assamesemale_04481 " they are a little heavy but i know. " )
( train_assamesemale_04482 " the shape is just right i will just go back. " )
( train_assamesemale_04483 " to the workshop and make them. " )
( train_assamesemale_04484 " out of another material something lighter. " )
( train_assamesemale_04485 " a couple of weeks later lenny called up rudy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04486 " i have done it said lenny you have done what. " )
( train_assamesemale_04487 " asked rudy i reworked the wings. " )
( train_assamesemale_04488 " these things are so light i may get. " )
( train_assamesemale_04489 " by simply jumping off the roof. " )
( train_assamesemale_04490 " come on over i need a witness said lenny. " )
( train_assamesemale_04491 " i am on the way said rudy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04492 " when rudy arrived lenny was already up. " )
( train_assamesemale_04493 " on the roof with these hilarious looking pink wings. " )
( train_assamesemale_04494 " pink wings laughed rudy this is the stuff. " )
( train_assamesemale_04495 " i had left over from when i invented. " )
( train_assamesemale_04496 " that giant pig robot we used on halloween last year. " )
( train_assamesemale_04497 " so you think you are just going to jump off. " )
( train_assamesemale_04498 " and fly asked rudy here goes said lenny. " )
( train_assamesemale_04499 " he backed up a little and took a quick dash. " )
( train_assamesemale_04500 " and a jump smack the wings broke right off. " )
( train_assamesemale_04501 " and lenny landed on his head. " )
( train_assamesemale_04502 " in the middle of some bushes next to the house. " )
( train_assamesemale_04503 " after rudy rolled around on the ground laughing. " )
( train_assamesemale_04504 " for about a minute he got up. " )
( train_assamesemale_04505 " and asked lenny if he was ok real funny said lenny. " )
( train_assamesemale_04506 " i guess they may have been a little weak. " )
( train_assamesemale_04507 " but i know the shape is just right. " )
( train_assamesemale_04508 " i will just go back to the workshop. " )
( train_assamesemale_04509 " and make them out of another material. " )
( train_assamesemale_04510 " something not as heavy as the scrap metal. " )
( train_assamesemale_04511 " and not as light as the tissue paper. " )
( train_assamesemale_04512 " sounds like a good idea to me said rudy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04513 " as he rolled his eyes. " )
( train_assamesemale_04514 " a couple of weeks later lenny called up rudy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04515 " i have really done it this time said lenny. " )
( train_assamesemale_04516 " you have done what asked rudy i reworked the wings. " )
( train_assamesemale_04517 " i made them out of wax and balsa wood. " )
( train_assamesemale_04518 " these things look just like birds wings. " )
( train_assamesemale_04519 " meet me at kill devil hill. " )
( train_assamesemale_04520 " i need a witness said lenny. " )
( train_assamesemale_04521 " i am on the way said rudy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04522 " when rudy arrived he saw the wings. " )
( train_assamesemale_04523 " they did look good i need you to help me. " )
( train_assamesemale_04524 " strap them on said lenny rudy helped him. " )
( train_assamesemale_04525 " strap on the wings they fit real snug. " )
( train_assamesemale_04526 " there was a handle under each wing out near the tip. " )
( train_assamesemale_04527 " for lenny to use to move the wings up. " )
( train_assamesemale_04528 " and down and a belt that went around. " )
( train_assamesemale_04529 " his waste so that they would not fall off. " )
( train_assamesemale_04530 " here we go yelled lenny as he backed up. " )
( train_assamesemale_04531 " and began running towards the crest of the hill. " )
( train_assamesemale_04532 " he did not slow down and just as he got to the edge. " )
( train_assamesemale_04533 " of the hill he started to lift up into the air. " )
( train_assamesemale_04534 " he was flying he flew and flew just laughing and hooting. " )
( train_assamesemale_04535 " he flew higher and higher. " )
( train_assamesemale_04536 " he was really getting high now. " )
( train_assamesemale_04537 " and he started to worry how do i land these things. " )
( train_assamesemale_04538 " he asked himself that question was about to be answered. " )
( train_assamesemale_04539 " all of a sudden he noticed that. " )
( train_assamesemale_04540 " his wings were starting to melt he had risen so high. " )
( train_assamesemale_04541 " that the sun was starting to melt the wax. " )
( train_assamesemale_04542 " he used to make the wings pretty soon he had little tiny wings. " )
( train_assamesemale_04543 " he was flying about a hundred miles an hour down towards the woods. " )
( train_assamesemale_04544 " boy this is going hurt again said lenny to himself. " )
( train_assamesemale_04545 " he crashed into the trees rudy ran up. " )
( train_assamesemale_04546 " are you all right he asked yes i think so. " )
( train_assamesemale_04547 " but i am definitely going to quite trying to fly. " )
( train_assamesemale_04548 " this is too rough on the body said lenny. " )
( train_assamesemale_04549 " to this day no one believes rudy when he tells. " )
( train_assamesemale_04550 " the story of how lenny flew like a bird. " )
( train_assamesemale_04551 " it may be good that they do not believe him. " )
( train_assamesemale_04552 " because others would probably get hurt as did lenny. " )
( train_assamesemale_04553 " lenny also made a commitment not to invent anything. " )
( train_assamesemale_04554 " that cannot be used while standing firmly on the ground. " )
( train_assamesemale_04555 " he often tells people if people were meant to fly. " )
( train_assamesemale_04556 " they would have wings. " )
( train_assamesemale_04557 " once upon a time there lived a boy named bill. " )
( train_assamesemale_04558 " who always dreamed of flying to the moon. " )
( train_assamesemale_04559 " one summer evening when bill was trying to go to sleep. " )
( train_assamesemale_04560 " he was bothered by his big brother ron. " )
( train_assamesemale_04561 " the only way bill could go to sleep was to put. " )
( train_assamesemale_04562 " on some headphones and play a tape. " )
( train_assamesemale_04563 " his favourite tape had the sound of. " )
( train_assamesemale_04564 " the ocean waves splashing up on shore. " )
( train_assamesemale_04565 " as he lay there in bed with his eyes closed pretending. " )
( train_assamesemale_04566 " he was lying on the beach under a full moon. " )
( train_assamesemale_04567 " he began to daydream about flying to the moon. " )
( train_assamesemale_04568 " in a rocket ship the rocket ship was not very big. " )
( train_assamesemale_04569 " just big enough for two astronauts. " )
( train_assamesemale_04570 " he and his brother ron were co astronauts. " )
( train_assamesemale_04571 " bill called out to ron navigator ready. " )
( train_assamesemale_04572 " ron called back in the headset yes navigator ready. " )
( train_assamesemale_04573 " mission control ready bill asked into the headset. " )
( train_assamesemale_04574 " we will begin countdown in minus ten seconds. " )
( train_assamesemale_04575 " nine seconds eight seconds bills heart began to race. " )
( train_assamesemale_04576 " two seconds one blastoff. " )
( train_assamesemale_04577 " bill and ron were thrown back into their seats. " )
( train_assamesemale_04578 " they could feel the skin on their faces. " )
( train_assamesemale_04579 " being stretched back towards their ears. " )
( train_assamesemale_04580 " then they felt like they weighed hundred pounds apiece. " )
( train_assamesemale_04581 " their rocket ship zoomed up into the sky. " )
( train_assamesemale_04582 " so fast everything out the window was just a blur. " )
( train_assamesemale_04583 " it seemed like just a couple of minutes had gone by. " )
( train_assamesemale_04584 " when everything got really smooth and quiet. " )
( train_assamesemale_04585 " they were now in outer space. " )
( train_assamesemale_04586 " bill was sitting in the front seat. " )
( train_assamesemale_04587 " and ron was in the back. " )
( train_assamesemale_04588 " bill asked ron what does it look like out the back. " )
( train_assamesemale_04589 " it looks like earth is just a blue and white ball. " )
( train_assamesemale_04590 " you can see the clouds and oceans. " )
( train_assamesemale_04591 " but you cannot see any cities or trees. " )
( train_assamesemale_04592 " ron asked bill can you see the moon coming up. " )
( train_assamesemale_04593 " yes i see it bill said. " )
( train_assamesemale_04594 " i think we will be there in about thirty minutes. " )
( train_assamesemale_04595 " if my calculations are correct were going. " )
( train_assamesemale_04596 " twenty five thousand miles per hour. " )
( train_assamesemale_04597 " and it is about fifty thousand miles to the moon. " )
( train_assamesemale_04598 " cool said ron i think i will play my game boy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04599 " and listen to some music on my boom box. " )
( train_assamesemale_04600 " you brought your boom box bill was obviously annoyed. " )
( train_assamesemale_04601 " you know i do not go anywhere without my boom box said ron. " )
( train_assamesemale_04602 " he turned on the music and the boys listened. " )
( train_assamesemale_04603 " the time quickly passed mission control. " )
( train_assamesemale_04604 " to bill came over the headsets bill here. " )
( train_assamesemale_04605 " you will need to prepare for landing in two minutes. " )
( train_assamesemale_04606 " said the voice roger well be ready said bill. " )
( train_assamesemale_04607 " here we go hold on it looks like it. " )
( train_assamesemale_04608 " might be a rough landing the rocket ship came in very rough. " )
( train_assamesemale_04609 " so rough that both bill and rons air bags deployed. " )
( train_assamesemale_04610 " but that airbag hit me in their face like a rock hard pillow. " )
( train_assamesemale_04611 " i think my nose would be bleeding. " )
( train_assamesemale_04612 " if i did not have on this helmet lets take a look around. " )
( train_assamesemale_04613 " and see if the rocket ship good idea said ron. " )
( train_assamesemale_04614 " they put on their moon walk suits. " )
( train_assamesemale_04615 " the moon walk suits were big and heavy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04616 " they had built in air conditioners to cool them. " )
( train_assamesemale_04617 " when the sun was on them and a heater to warm them up. " )
( train_assamesemale_04618 " when they were in the shade. " )
( train_assamesemale_04619 " since they were in outer space it would go way. " )
( train_assamesemale_04620 " below freezing in the shade. " )
( train_assamesemale_04621 " and get so hot you could get burned in the sun. " )
( train_assamesemale_04622 " when they stepped outside they felt like. " )
( train_assamesemale_04623 " they were floating on air. " )
( train_assamesemale_04624 " they only weighed about six pounds each. " )
( train_assamesemale_04625 " so when they walked it was as if they bounced. " )
( train_assamesemale_04626 " they bounced up about ten feet with each step. " )
( train_assamesemale_04627 " they quickly gathered up some moon rocks as souvenirs. " )
( train_assamesemale_04628 " then they began to inspect the rocket. " )
( train_assamesemale_04629 " to make sure it was flyable for the return trip. " )
( train_assamesemale_04630 " things did not look good. " )
( train_assamesemale_04631 " the portion of the ship that housed. " )
( train_assamesemale_04632 " the rocket starter was heavily damaged. " )
( train_assamesemale_04633 " the batteries that turned the starter were completely destroyed. " )
( train_assamesemale_04634 " they began to fear that they might be trapped on the moon. " )
( train_assamesemale_04635 " what are we going to do asked ron. " )
( train_assamesemale_04636 " he looked scared i dont know bill answered. " )
( train_assamesemale_04637 " lets call mission control. " )
( train_assamesemale_04638 " and see if they have any suggestions. " )
( train_assamesemale_04639 " they went back inside and tossed the moon rocks aside. " )
( train_assamesemale_04640 " they called mission control. " )
( train_assamesemale_04641 " we will get back to you was the answer. " )
( train_assamesemale_04642 " they needed time to think. " )
( train_assamesemale_04643 " we only have enough food and water for one more day. " )
( train_assamesemale_04644 " ron reminded bill yeah we will really need to conserve it. " )
( train_assamesemale_04645 " they nervously sat in their seats. " )
( train_assamesemale_04646 " and waited for mission control no reply. " )
( train_assamesemale_04647 " after a while bill jumped up and said i have got it. " )
( train_assamesemale_04648 " give me your boom box ron said what are you crazy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04649 " no just give it to me said bill. " )
( train_assamesemale_04650 " ron surrendered his boom box. " )
( train_assamesemale_04651 " bill took it and turned it on real loud and smiled. " )
( train_assamesemale_04652 " ron looked sad he just knew that bill was losing his mind. " )
( train_assamesemale_04653 " then bill turned off the music. " )
( train_assamesemale_04654 " and flipped the boom box upside down. " )
( train_assamesemale_04655 " he opened the battery compartment. " )
( train_assamesemale_04656 " and took out the eight large batteries. " )
( train_assamesemale_04657 " i think we can tape these together and make one big battery. " )
( train_assamesemale_04658 " that will start the rocket said bill. " )
( train_assamesemale_04659 " hand me that duct take from the tool kit. " )
( train_assamesemale_04660 " sounds like a good idea to me said ron. " )
( train_assamesemale_04661 " bill lined up the batteries in two rows of four. " )
( train_assamesemale_04662 " and taped them together in a bundle. " )
( train_assamesemale_04663 " he took a piece of tape and connected a wire. " )
( train_assamesemale_04664 " to the batteries on each end. " )
( train_assamesemale_04665 " he hooked one up to the starter. " )
( train_assamesemale_04666 " he took the other wire and ran it back up to. " )
( train_assamesemale_04667 " his seat in the front bill told ron to get in his seat. " )
( train_assamesemale_04668 " if i touch the wire to the metal on the dashboard. " )
( train_assamesemale_04669 " the starter should work and we can blast off. " )
( train_assamesemale_04670 " ron hoped that he was right are you ready. " )
( train_assamesemale_04671 " bill asked ron without waiting for an answer. " )
( train_assamesemale_04672 " as he touched the wire to the dashboard. " )
( train_assamesemale_04673 " they could hear the roar of the rocket. " )
( train_assamesemale_04674 " before they knew it they were zooming back. " )
( train_assamesemale_04675 " through space towards earth how they both yelled. " )
( train_assamesemale_04676 " just then bills mom pulled the headphones off of his head. " )
( train_assamesemale_04677 " and told him to go on to sleep. " )
( train_assamesemale_04678 " it was easy for bill to get back to sleep. " )
( train_assamesemale_04679 " because he hoped he could pick up. " )
( train_assamesemale_04680 " his rocket ship dream right where he left off. " )
( train_assamesemale_04681 " it was a windy day. " )
( train_assamesemale_04682 " the mailman barely made it to the front door. " )
( train_assamesemale_04683 " when the door opened mistress pennington said hello. " )
( train_assamesemale_04684 " but before she had a real chance. " )
( train_assamesemale_04685 " to say thank you the mail blew out of the mailmans hands. " )
( train_assamesemale_04686 " into the house and the front door slammed in his face. " )
( train_assamesemale_04687 " worthwhile going any farther. " )
( train_assamesemale_04688 " they went back and told the frogs round the village. " )
( train_assamesemale_04689 " that they had seen the city. " )
( train_assamesemale_04690 " and it was just like theirs. " )
( train_assamesemale_04691 " over a river there was a very narrow bridge. " )
( train_assamesemale_04692 " one day a goat was crossing this bridge. " )
( train_assamesemale_04693 " just at the middle of the bridge. " )
( train_assamesemale_04694 " he met another goat. " )
( train_assamesemale_04695 " there was no room for them to pass. " )
( train_assamesemale_04696 " two goats go back said one goat to the other. " )
( train_assamesemale_04697 " there is no room for both of us. " )
( train_assamesemale_04698 " why should i go back said the other goat. " )
( train_assamesemale_04699 " why should not you go back. " )
( train_assamesemale_04700 " you must go back said the first goat. " )
( train_assamesemale_04701 " because i am stronger than you. " )
( train_assamesemale_04702 " you are not stronger. " )
( train_assamesemale_04703 " than i said the second goat. " )
( train_assamesemale_04704 " we will see about that said the first goat. " )
( train_assamesemale_04705 " and she put down his horns to fight. " )
( train_assamesemale_04706 " stop said the second goat. " )
( train_assamesemale_04707 " if we fight we shall both fall into. " )
( train_assamesemale_04708 " the river and be drowned. " )
( train_assamesemale_04709 " instead i have a plan i shall lie down. " )
( train_assamesemale_04710 " and you may walk over me. " )
( train_assamesemale_04711 " then the wise goat lay down on the bridge. " )
( train_assamesemale_04712 " and the other goat walked lightly over him. " )
( train_assamesemale_04713 " so they passed each other. " )
( train_assamesemale_04714 " and went on their ways. " )
( train_assamesemale_04715 " once upon a time in an island. " )
( train_assamesemale_04716 " there lived all the feelings. " )
( train_assamesemale_04717 " and emotions happiness sadness knowledge. " )
( train_assamesemale_04718 " and all of the others including love. " )
( train_assamesemale_04719 " and he said aloud to himself. " )
( train_assamesemale_04720 " wonderful flowers on the bamboo have brought me. " )
( train_assamesemale_04721 " both the young pandas have to be friends with me. " )
( train_assamesemale_04722 " i will lure them away and feast on them. " )
( train_assamesemale_04723 " the hyena once again came to the pandas. " )
( train_assamesemale_04724 " and said now the flowers have bloomed. " )
( train_assamesemale_04725 " on the bamboo hurry up and get down. " )
( train_assamesemale_04726 " to shake hands with me. " )
( train_assamesemale_04727 " mickey was very upset and was at his wits end. " )
( train_assamesemale_04728 " as to how to get rid of the beast this time. " )
( train_assamesemale_04729 " jackie however was least afraid of the hyena. " )
( train_assamesemale_04730 " he was busy sharpening a thick bamboo. " )
( train_assamesemale_04731 " pointed at both its ends. " )
( train_assamesemale_04732 " when the bamboo became pointed. " )
( train_assamesemale_04733 " he hurled it towards the hyena. " )
( train_assamesemale_04734 " he pointed towards the pointed bamboo. " )
( train_assamesemale_04735 " and said we can become friends only. " )
( train_assamesemale_04736 " and barks and jumps on its masters knee. " )
( train_assamesemale_04737 " it is not fair then the donkey said to himself. " )
( train_assamesemale_04738 " if i do what the dog does he may make a pet of me. " )
( train_assamesemale_04739 " so the donkey ran into the room. " )
( train_assamesemale_04740 " it brayed as loudly as it could. " )
( train_assamesemale_04741 " it wagged its tail so hard. " )
( train_assamesemale_04742 " that it knocked over a jar on the table. " )
( train_assamesemale_04743 " then it tried to jump on to its masters knee. " )
( train_assamesemale_04744 " the master thought the donkey was mad. " )
( train_assamesemale_04745 " and he shouted help help. " )
( train_assamesemale_04746 " men came running in with sticks. " )
( train_assamesemale_04747 " and they beat the donkey. " )
( train_assamesemale_04748 " till it ran out of the house. " )
( train_assamesemale_04749 " and they drove it back to the field. " )
( train_assamesemale_04750 " i only did what the dog does said the donkey. " )
( train_assamesemale_04751 " and yet they make a pet of the dog. " )
( train_assamesemale_04752 " and they beat me with sticks it is not fair. " )
( train_assamesemale_04753 " once upon a time there lived a pauper and a banker. " )
( train_assamesemale_04754 " the first was as poor as the second was rich. " )
( train_assamesemale_04755 " so it was inevitable that. " )
( train_assamesemale_04756 " the rich man will be happier than the pauper. " )
( train_assamesemale_04757 " but their natures were opposite. " )
( train_assamesemale_04758 " for the poor man was happy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04759 " whereas the banker was not. " )
( train_assamesemale_04760 " the banker was annoyed of the fact. " )
( train_assamesemale_04761 " that while he tossed and turned in his bed. " )
( train_assamesemale_04762 " at night the pauper slept peacefully. " )
( train_assamesemale_04763 " and always awoke rested and full of energy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04764 " one day the banker could stand it no longer. " )
( train_assamesemale_04765 " he decided to find out. " )
( train_assamesemale_04766 " why the pauper was a happy man. " )
( train_assamesemale_04767 " in spite of his poverty. " )
( train_assamesemale_04768 " so he summoned him to his house. " )
( train_assamesemale_04769 " and asked him his yearly income. " )
( train_assamesemale_04770 " because he believed that happiness. " )
( train_assamesemale_04771 " could only be measured in terms of wealth. " )
( train_assamesemale_04772 " i do not count too well nor do i really care. " )
( train_assamesemale_04773 " i live each day as it comes. " )
( train_assamesemale_04774 " and never worry about the next. " )
( train_assamesemale_04775 " then just tell me how much you earn in one day. " )
( train_assamesemale_04776 " insisted the rich man i earned what i need. " )
( train_assamesemale_04777 " and even that would be too much were it not for. " )
( train_assamesemale_04778 " all the sundays and holidays. " )
( train_assamesemale_04779 " when i must close my shop. " )
( train_assamesemale_04780 " the banker liked the pauper. " )
( train_assamesemale_04781 " to thank him for coming to his house. " )
( train_assamesemale_04782 " so he presented the poor man. " )
( train_assamesemale_04783 " with a bag of hundred gold coins. " )
( train_assamesemale_04784 " now to the pauper these coins. " )
( train_assamesemale_04785 " which meant so little to the banker. " )
( train_assamesemale_04786 " seemed a great fortune. " )
( train_assamesemale_04787 " he decided to hide the bag. " )
( train_assamesemale_04788 " so that he would have the money. " )
( train_assamesemale_04789 " if ever he should need it. " )
( train_assamesemale_04790 " so when he returned to his house. " )
( train_assamesemale_04791 " he dug a big hole in a corner of the garden. " )
( train_assamesemale_04792 " threw the bag into it and covered it with dirt. " )
( train_assamesemale_04793 " pauper but from that day on the poor man. " )
( train_assamesemale_04794 " life changed he began to worry about. " )
( train_assamesemale_04795 " the safety of his money. " )
( train_assamesemale_04796 " every night he slept a little less. " )
( train_assamesemale_04797 " and each time he heard the slightest sound. " )
( train_assamesemale_04798 " he became anxious about the safety of his coins. " )
( train_assamesemale_04799 " finally he could bear his unhappiness no longer. " )
( train_assamesemale_04800 " he went to the garden dug up the coins. " )
( train_assamesemale_04801 " and returned them to the banker. " )
( train_assamesemale_04802 " the pauper had learned an important lesson. " )
( train_assamesemale_04803 " and so has the banker a wolf carried off a lamb. " )
( train_assamesemale_04804 " the lamb said i know you are going to eat me. " )
( train_assamesemale_04805 " but before you eat me i would like to hear. " )
( train_assamesemale_04806 " you play the flute. " )
( train_assamesemale_04807 " i have heard that you can play the flute. " )
( train_assamesemale_04808 " better than anyone else. " )
( train_assamesemale_04809 " even the shepherd himself. " )
( train_assamesemale_04810 " the wolf was so pleased at this. " )
( train_assamesemale_04811 " that he took out his flute and began to play. " )
( train_assamesemale_04812 " when he had done the lamb insisted him. " )
( train_assamesemale_04813 " to play once more and the wolf played again. " )
( train_assamesemale_04814 " the shepherd and the dogs heard the sound. " )
( train_assamesemale_04815 " and they came running up. " )
( train_assamesemale_04816 " and fell on the wolf and the lamb was able to. " )
( train_assamesemale_04817 " get back to the flock. " )
( train_assamesemale_04818 " two frogs had lived in a village. " )
( train_assamesemale_04819 " all their lives they thought they would like to go. " )
( train_assamesemale_04820 " and see the big city that was about ten miles away. " )
( train_assamesemale_04821 " they talked about it for a long time. " )
( train_assamesemale_04822 " and at last they set off to see the city. " )
( train_assamesemale_04823 " and they soon began to feel tired. " )
( train_assamesemale_04824 " they had only gone a little way. " )
( train_assamesemale_04825 " when one said to the other. " )
( train_assamesemale_04826 " we must be nearly there. " )
( train_assamesemale_04827 " can you see the city. " )
( train_assamesemale_04828 " no said the other frog. " )
( train_assamesemale_04829 " but if i climb on your back. " )
( train_assamesemale_04830 " i might be able to see it. " )
( train_assamesemale_04831 " so he climbed up on the back of the other frog. " )
( train_assamesemale_04832 " to see the city now when the frog put up his head. " )
( train_assamesemale_04833 " his eyes could only see what was behind. " )
( train_assamesemale_04834 " and not what was in front. " )
( train_assamesemale_04835 " so he saw the village they had just left. " )
( train_assamesemale_04836 " can you see the city. " )
( train_assamesemale_04837 " asked the frog who was below. " )
( train_assamesemale_04838 " yes answered the frog who had climbed up. " )
( train_assamesemale_04839 " i can see it it looks just like our village. " )
( train_assamesemale_04840 " then the frogs thought that it was not. " )
( train_assamesemale_04841 " worthwhile going any farther. " )
( train_assamesemale_04842 " they went back and told the frogs round the village. " )
( train_assamesemale_04843 " that they had seen the city. " )
( train_assamesemale_04844 " and it was just like theirs. " )
( train_assamesemale_04845 " over a river there was a very narrow bridge. " )
( train_assamesemale_04846 " one day a goat was crossing this bridge. " )
( train_assamesemale_04847 " just at the middle of the bridge. " )
( train_assamesemale_04848 " he met another goat. " )
( train_assamesemale_04849 " there was no room for them to pass. " )
( train_assamesemale_04850 " two goats go back said one goat to the other. " )
( train_assamesemale_04851 " there is no room for both of us. " )
( train_assamesemale_04852 " why should i go back said the other goat. " )
( train_assamesemale_04853 " when you put the bamboo in your mouth. " )
( train_assamesemale_04854 " and jump from that cliff. " )
( train_assamesemale_04855 " the hyena asked but why should i jump. " )
( train_assamesemale_04856 " with bamboo in my mouth. " )
( train_assamesemale_04857 " can not we become friends without this exercise. " )
( train_assamesemale_04858 " absolutely not our mother had said. " )
( train_assamesemale_04859 " that if the hyena does not jump. " )
( train_assamesemale_04860 " with the bamboo in his mouth. " )
( train_assamesemale_04861 " we should not be friends with him. " )
( train_assamesemale_04862 " if you have to be our friend then you have to. " )
( train_assamesemale_04863 " do as i say said jackie very seriously. " )
( train_assamesemale_04864 " the hyena became thoughtful. " )
( train_assamesemale_04865 " he was thoroughly trapped in jackeys trap. " )
( train_assamesemale_04866 " if he refused to do what was being told. " )
( train_assamesemale_04867 " he had to retreat. " )
( train_assamesemale_04868 " finally under compulsion he decided to. " )
( train_assamesemale_04869 " jump with the bamboo in his mouth. " )
( train_assamesemale_04870 " despite his reluctance the hyena inserted. " )
( train_assamesemale_04871 " the pointed end of the bamboo in his mouth. " )
( train_assamesemale_04872 " and climbed the cliff and jumped. " )
( train_assamesemale_04873 " the moment he landed on the ground. " )
( train_assamesemale_04874 " the hyena shouted loudly in pain oh my god. " )
( train_assamesemale_04875 " i am dead the bamboo has pierced through my neck. " )
( train_assamesemale_04876 " the panda brothers jumped with joy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04877 " mean while the mother panda had also returned. " )
( train_assamesemale_04878 " after visiting her sister. " )
( train_assamesemale_04879 " she saw the hyena writhing in pain. " )
( train_assamesemale_04880 " jackey and mickey told her everything. " )
( train_assamesemale_04881 " when she came to know everything. " )
( train_assamesemale_04882 " and said well done you have proved. " )
( train_assamesemale_04883 " that both of you are brave and intelligent. " )
( train_assamesemale_04884 " and can defend yourself from prying enemies. " )
( train_assamesemale_04885 " the hyena with the bamboo stuck. " )
( train_assamesemale_04886 " in his mouth was in a really bad shape. " )
( train_assamesemale_04887 " he ran away as fast as he could. " )
( train_assamesemale_04888 " and was never seen in the jungle again. " )
( train_assamesemale_04889 " a man had a little dog. " )
( train_assamesemale_04890 " and he was very fond of it. " )
( train_assamesemale_04891 " he would pat its head and take it on his knee. " )
( train_assamesemale_04892 " and talk to it then he would give it. " )
( train_assamesemale_04893 " little bits of food from his own plate. " )
( train_assamesemale_04894 " a donkey looked in at the window. " )
( train_assamesemale_04895 " and saw the man and the dog. " )
( train_assamesemale_04896 " why does he not make a pet of me. " )
( train_assamesemale_04897 " said the donkey it is not fair. " )
( train_assamesemale_04898 " i work hard and the dog only wags its tail. " )
( train_assamesemale_04899 " and he put down his horns to fight. " )
( train_assamesemale_04900 " stop said the second goat. " )
( train_assamesemale_04901 " if we fight we shall both fall into. " )
( train_assamesemale_04902 " the river and be drowned. " )
( train_assamesemale_04903 " instead i have a plan i shall lie down. " )
( train_assamesemale_04904 " and you may walk over me. " )
( train_assamesemale_04905 " then the wise goat lay down on the bridge. " )
( train_assamesemale_04906 " and the other goat walked lightly over him. " )
( train_assamesemale_04907 " so they passed each other. " )
( train_assamesemale_04908 " and went on their ways. " )
( train_assamesemale_04909 " once upon a time in an island. " )
( train_assamesemale_04910 " there lived all the feelings. " )
( train_assamesemale_04911 " and emotions happiness sadness knowledge. " )

( train_assamesemale_04915 " so all constructed boats and let except for love. " )
( train_assamesemale_04916 " love wanted to hold out until. " )
( train_assamesemale_04917 " the last possible moment. " )
( train_assamesemale_04918 " when the island had almost sunk. " )
( train_assamesemale_04919 " love decided to ask for help. " )
( train_assamesemale_04920 " richness was passing by love in a boat. " )
( train_assamesemale_04921 " love said richness can you take me with you. " )
( train_assamesemale_04922 " richness answered sorry love i can not. " )
( train_assamesemale_04923 " there is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. " )
( train_assamesemale_04924 " and so there is no place here for you. " )
( train_assamesemale_04925 " love next asked vanity who was also sailing by. " )
( train_assamesemale_04926 " vanity was also ready with the same answer. " )
( train_assamesemale_04927 " i cant help you love you are all wet. " )
( train_assamesemale_04928 " and might damage my boat vanity answered. " )
( train_assamesemale_04929 " sadness was close by so love asked sadness. " )
( train_assamesemale_04930 " take me along with you love i am so sad. " )
( train_assamesemale_04931 " that i need to be by myself. " )
( train_assamesemale_04932 " sadness said in a sullen voice. " )
( train_assamesemale_04933 " happiness passed by love too. " )
( train_assamesemale_04934 " but she was so preoccupied. " )
( train_assamesemale_04935 " with her happiness that she did not even. " )
( train_assamesemale_04936 " hear when love called her. " )
( train_assamesemale_04937 " suddenly there was a voice come. " )
( train_assamesemale_04938 " love i will take you it was an elder. " )
( train_assamesemale_04939 " an overjoyed love jumped up into the boat. " )
( train_assamesemale_04940 " and in the process forgot to ask where they were going. " )
( train_assamesemale_04941 " when they arrived at a dry land. " )
( train_assamesemale_04942 " the elder went her own way. " )
( train_assamesemale_04943 " realizing how much was owned to the elder. " )
( train_assamesemale_04944 " love asked knowledge another elder. " )
( train_assamesemale_04945 " who helped me it was time knowledge answered. " )
( train_assamesemale_04946 " time thought love then as if reading. " )
( train_assamesemale_04947 " the face of love knowledge smiled and answered. " )
( train_assamesemale_04948 " because only time is capable of understanding. " )
( train_assamesemale_04949 " how valuable love is a shepherd boy. " )
( train_assamesemale_04950 " who watched a flock of sheep near a village. " )
( train_assamesemale_04951 " brought out the villagers three or four times. " )
( train_assamesemale_04952 " by crying out wolf and when his neighbours came. " )
( train_assamesemale_04953 " to help him laughed at them for their pains. " )
( train_assamesemale_04954 " the wolf however did truly come at last. " )
( train_assamesemale_04955 " the shepherd boy now really alarmed. " )
( train_assamesemale_04956 " shouted in an agony of terror pray. " )
( train_assamesemale_04957 " do come and help me. " )
( train_assamesemale_04958 " the wolf is killing the sheep. " )
( train_assamesemale_04959 " but no one paid any heed to his cries. " )
( train_assamesemale_04960 " nor rendered any assistance. " )
( train_assamesemale_04961 " the wolf having no cause of fear. " )
( train_assamesemale_04962 " at his leisure destroyed the whole flock. " )
( train_assamesemale_04963 " there is no believing a liar even. " )
( train_assamesemale_04964 " when he speaks the truth. " )
( train_assamesemale_04965 " miser sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold. " )
( train_assamesemale_04966 " which he buried in a hole in the ground by the side. " )

( train_assamesemale_04968 " one of his workmen observed his frequent visits to the spot. " )
( train_assamesemale_04969 " and decided to watch his movements. " )
( train_assamesemale_04970 " he soon discovered the secret of the hidden treasure. " )
( train_assamesemale_04971 " and digging down came to the lump of gold. " )
( train_assamesemale_04972 " and stole it the miser on his next visit found the hole empty. " )
( train_assamesemale_04973 " and began to tear his hair and to make loud lamentations. " )
( train_assamesemale_04974 " a neighbour seeing him overcome with grief. " )
( train_assamesemale_04975 " and learning the cause said pray do not grieve so. " )
( train_assamesemale_04976 " but go and take a stone and place it in the hole. " )
( train_assamesemale_04977 " and fancy that the gold is still lying there. " )
( train_assamesemale_04978 " it will do you quite the same service. " )
( train_assamesemale_04979 " for when the gold was there you had it not. " )

( train_assamesemale_04997 " but the second he declared his love. " )
( train_assamesemale_04998 " and asked for her hand thousands of goblins. " )
( train_assamesemale_04999 " appeared to grasp him and push him over. " )
( train_assamesemale_05000 " the rocks down into bottomless abysses. " )
( train_assamesemale_05001 " without the slightest emotion. " )
( train_assamesemale_05002 " the queen would watch the scene. " )

( train_assamesemale_05004 " the legend of the crystal palace. " )
( train_assamesemale_05005 " and the beautiful heartless queen. " )
( train_assamesemale_05006 " spread as far as the most distant alpine valley. " )
( train_assamesemale_05007 " the home of a fearless chamois hunter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05008 " fascinated by the tale he decided to set out. " )
( train_assamesemale_05009 " and try this luck. " )
( train_assamesemale_05010 " leaving his valley he journeyed for days on end. " )
( train_assamesemale_05011 " climbing the snow clad mountain faces. " )
( train_assamesemale_05012 " scaling icebound peaks and defying the bitterly. " )
( train_assamesemale_05013 " cold wind that swept through the alpine gullies. " )
( train_assamesemale_05014 " more than once he felt. " )
( train_assamesemale_05015 " all was lost but the thought of the lovely snow. " )
( train_assamesemale_05016 " queen gave him new strength and kept him moving onwards. " )
( train_assamesemale_05017 " at last after many days climbing. " )
( train_assamesemale_05018 " he saw glinting in the sunshine before him. " )
( train_assamesemale_05019 " the tall transparent spires of the ice palace. " )
( train_assamesemale_05020 " summoning all his courage. " )
( train_assamesemale_05021 " the young man entered the throne room. " )
( train_assamesemale_05022 " but he was so struck by the snow queens beauty. " )
( train_assamesemale_05023 " that he could not utter a word. " )
( train_assamesemale_05024 " shy and timid he did not dare speak. " )
( train_assamesemale_05025 " so he knelt in admiration before the queen. " )
( train_assamesemale_05026 " for hours on end without opening his mouth. " )
( train_assamesemale_05027 " the queen looked at him silently. " )
( train_assamesemale_05028 " thinking all the while that provided. " )
( train_assamesemale_05029 " he did not ask her hand in marriage. " )
( train_assamesemale_05030 " there was no need to call the goblins. " )
( train_assamesemale_05031 " then to her great surprise. " )
( train_assamesemale_05032 " she discovered that his behaviour touched her heart. " )
( train_assamesemale_05033 " she realised she was becoming quite fond of this hunter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05034 " much younger and more handsome than her other suitors. " )
( train_assamesemale_05035 " time passed and the snow queen dared not admit. " )
( train_assamesemale_05036 " not even to herself that she would actually like to. " )
( train_assamesemale_05037 " marry the young man. " )
( train_assamesemale_05038 " in the meantime the goblins kept watch over their mistress. " )
( train_assamesemale_05039 " first they were astonished. " )
( train_assamesemale_05040 " then they became more and more upset. " )
( train_assamesemale_05041 " for they rightly feared that their queen. " )
( train_assamesemale_05042 " might be on the point of breaking the law. " )
( train_assamesemale_05043 " and bringing down on the heads of all. " )
( train_assamesemale_05044 " the mountain people the fury of fate. " )
( train_assamesemale_05045 " seeing that the queen was slow. " )
( train_assamesemale_05046 " to give the order to get rid of her suitor. " )
( train_assamesemale_05047 " the goblins decided to take matters into their own hands. " )
( train_assamesemale_05048 " one night as dusk fell. " )
( train_assamesemale_05049 " they slipped out the cracks in the rock. " )
( train_assamesemale_05050 " and clustered round the young chamois hunter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05051 " then they hurled him into the abyss. " )
( train_assamesemale_05052 " the snow queen watched the whole scene from the window. " )
( train_assamesemale_05053 " but there was nothing she could do to stop them. " )
( train_assamesemale_05054 " however her icy heart melted. " )
( train_assamesemale_05055 " and the beautiful cruel fairy suddenly became a woman. " )
( train_assamesemale_05056 " a tear dropped from her eye. " )
( train_assamesemale_05057 " the first she had ever shed. " )
( train_assamesemale_05058 " and the snow queens tear fell on to a stone. " )
( train_assamesemale_05059 " where it turned into a little silvery star. " )
( train_assamesemale_05060 " this was the first edelweiss. " )
( train_assamesemale_05061 " the flower that grows only on the highest most inaccessible. " )
( train_assamesemale_05062 " peaks in the alps on the edge of the abyss and precipice. " )
( train_assamesemale_05063 " once upon a time there lived a stone cutter in a small village. " )
( train_assamesemale_05064 " all day long he worked hard cutting the hard stones. " )
( train_assamesemale_05065 " and making the shape which were needed by his customers. " )
( train_assamesemale_05066 " his hands were hard and his clothes were dirty. " )
( train_assamesemale_05067 " one day he went out to work on a big stone. " )
( train_assamesemale_05068 " it was very hard to work. " )
( train_assamesemale_05069 " and the sun was very hot. " )
( train_assamesemale_05070 " after spending several hours cutting the stone. " )
( train_assamesemale_05071 " he sat down in the shade and soon fell asleep. " )
( train_assamesemale_05072 " after sometime he heard sound of somebody coming. " )
( train_assamesemale_05073 " walking up he saw a long procession of people. " )
( train_assamesemale_05074 " there were many soldiers and attendants. " )
( train_assamesemale_05075 " and in the middle in a palanquin. " )
( train_assamesemale_05076 " carried by strong people at the king. " )
( train_assamesemale_05077 " how wonderful it must be to be the great king. " )
( train_assamesemale_05078 " thought the stone cutter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05079 " how happy i would be if i were the king. " )
( train_assamesemale_05080 " instead of a poor stone cutter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05081 " as he said these words a strange thing happened. " )
( train_assamesemale_05082 " the stone cutter found himself dressed. " )
( train_assamesemale_05083 " in silk clothes and shining jewels. " )
( train_assamesemale_05084 " his hands were soft. " )
( train_assamesemale_05085 " and he was sitting in a comfortable palanquin. " )
( train_assamesemale_05086 " as the afternoon wore on the sun grew hotter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05087 " the king became more and more uncomfortable. " )
( train_assamesemale_05088 " i am powerful it is true. " )
( train_assamesemale_05089 " but how more powerful than sun. " )
( train_assamesemale_05090 " he thought i would rather be the sun than a king. " )
( train_assamesemale_05091 " at once he became the sun. " )
( train_assamesemale_05092 " shining down on the earth. " )
( train_assamesemale_05093 " his new power was hard to control. " )
( train_assamesemale_05094 " he shone too strongly. " )
( train_assamesemale_05095 " he burned up the fields with his rays. " )
( train_assamesemale_05096 " and turned the ocean into vapour. " )
( train_assamesemale_05097 " and formed a great cloud which covered the land. " )
( train_assamesemale_05098 " but no matter how hard he shone. " )
( train_assamesemale_05099 " he could not see through the clouds. " )
( train_assamesemale_05100 " it is obvious that the clouds are even stronger. " )
( train_assamesemale_05101 " and more powerful than sun said the stone cutter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05102 " now the sun i would rather be a cloud. " )
( train_assamesemale_05103 " suddenly he found himself. " )
( train_assamesemale_05104 " turned into a huge dark cloud. " )
( train_assamesemale_05105 " he started using his new power. " )
( train_assamesemale_05106 " he poured rain down on the fields and caused floods. " )
( train_assamesemale_05107 " all the trees and houses were swept away. " )
( train_assamesemale_05108 " but a boulder which once he had been cutting. " )
( train_assamesemale_05109 " when he was a stone cutter and unchanged. " )
( train_assamesemale_05110 " however much he poured down on the stone. " )
( train_assamesemale_05111 " it did not move. " )
( train_assamesemale_05112 " why that rock is more powerful. " )
( train_assamesemale_05113 " than i am said the stone cutter now a cloud. " )
( train_assamesemale_05114 " only a stone cutter could change the rock by his skill. " )
( train_assamesemale_05115 " how i wish i were a stonecutter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05116 " no sooner he said the words. " )
( train_assamesemale_05117 " that he found himself sitting on a stone. " )
( train_assamesemale_05118 " with hard and rough hands. " )
( train_assamesemale_05119 " he picked up his tools. " )
( train_assamesemale_05120 " and set to work on a boulder happily. " )
( train_assamesemale_05121 " once in the royal city there was old woodcutter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05122 " who lived alone with his young daughter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05123 " every day the woodcutter went out to the desert. " )
( train_assamesemale_05124 " to gather camel thorn bushes. " )
( train_assamesemale_05125 " then sold them in the marketplace as firewood. " )
( train_assamesemale_05126 " in this way he earned barely. " )
( train_assamesemale_05127 " enough for the two of them. " )
( train_assamesemale_05128 " one morning the woodcutters daughter said father. " )
( train_assamesemale_05129 " we always have enough to eat. " )
( train_assamesemale_05130 " but just once it would be nice to have something special. " )
( train_assamesemale_05131 " do you think you could buy us some date cakes. " )
( train_assamesemale_05132 " i think i could do that my dear said the woodcutter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05133 " it will just gather some extra wood today. " )
( train_assamesemale_05134 " so the woodcutter walked farther that day. " )
( train_assamesemale_05135 " to gather more thorn bushes. " )
( train_assamesemale_05136 " but he took longer than he meant to. " )
( train_assamesemale_05137 " by the time he got back. " )
( train_assamesemale_05138 " with the wood darkness had fallen. " )
( train_assamesemale_05139 " it was too late to go to the marketplace. " )
( train_assamesemale_05140 " whats more then he reached his house he found. " )
( train_assamesemale_05141 " that his daughter had already bolted. " )

( train_assamesemale_05143 " knock as he would there was no answer. " )
( train_assamesemale_05144 " so he had to sleep outside on the doorstep. " )
( train_assamesemale_05145 " next morning the woodcutter awoke. " )
( train_assamesemale_05146 " while it was still dark. " )
( train_assamesemale_05147 " he told himself i might as well go out right. " )

( train_assamesemale_05153 " but again he took longer than he meant to. " )
( train_assamesemale_05154 " and when he got back. " )
( train_assamesemale_05155 " it was dark and the door was bolted. " )

( train_assamesemale_05163 " the woodcutter sank to the doorstep and wept. " )
( train_assamesemale_05164 " whats wrong old man. " )
( train_assamesemale_05165 " he looked up to see a dervish. " )
( train_assamesemale_05166 " in a long green robe. " )
( train_assamesemale_05167 " and a tall green cap. " )
( train_assamesemale_05168 " sir for three days i have gone out. " )

( train_assamesemale_05180 " here share this with me thank you sir. " )
( train_assamesemale_05181 " you may not know it the dervish went on. " )

( train_assamesemale_05187 " that way you both will be helped. " )
( train_assamesemale_05188 " and with that the holy man vanished. " )
( train_assamesemale_05189 " as the woodcutter stared at the empty spot. " )
( train_assamesemale_05190 " the door to his house swung open. " )
( train_assamesemale_05191 " father where have you been. " )
( train_assamesemale_05192 " please come inside i was so worried. " )

( train_assamesemale_05195 " the many date cakes he bought after selling his wood. " )
( train_assamesemale_05196 " then one morning when the woodcutter had gone. " )
( train_assamesemale_05197 " to the desert and his daughter had finished. " )
( train_assamesemale_05198 " her housework she decided to go. " )
( train_assamesemale_05199 " walking in a public park. " )
( train_assamesemale_05200 " she was strolling down a broad path. " )
( train_assamesemale_05201 " when a carriage stopped beside her. " )
( train_assamesemale_05202 " what a pretty little girl. " )
( train_assamesemale_05203 " said a royal young lady. " )
( train_assamesemale_05204 " i am the daughter of the king. " )
( train_assamesemale_05205 " would you like to be my handmaiden. " )
( train_assamesemale_05206 " yes your highness the girl said blushing. " )
( train_assamesemale_05207 " so the woodcutters daughter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05208 " became a handmaiden of the princess. " )
( train_assamesemale_05209 " with the gifts the princess gave her. " )
( train_assamesemale_05210 " she and her father became quite rich. " )
( train_assamesemale_05211 " he bought a nice house. " )
( train_assamesemale_05212 " and he did not have to gather thorn bushes any more. " )
( train_assamesemale_05213 " but somehow he forgot what the dervish told him. " )
( train_assamesemale_05214 " a month went by one day the princess went. " )
( train_assamesemale_05215 " on a picnic to one of her fathers private gardens. " )
( train_assamesemale_05216 " and she brought along the woodcutters daughter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05217 " there was a small lake there. " )
( train_assamesemale_05218 " so they decided to go for a swim. " )
( train_assamesemale_05219 " the princess took off her necklace. " )
( train_assamesemale_05220 " and hung it on a branch overlooking the water. " )
( train_assamesemale_05221 " but when she came out she forgot all about it. " )
( train_assamesemale_05222 " a few days later at the palace. " )
( train_assamesemale_05223 " the princess looked for the necklace. " )
( train_assamesemale_05224 " but could not find it. " )
( train_assamesemale_05225 " she turned angrily to the woodcutters daughter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05226 " you stole my necklace. " )
( train_assamesemale_05227 " you must have taken it when we went for our swim. " )
( train_assamesemale_05228 " no your highness i would not do that. " )
( train_assamesemale_05229 " you are a thief and a liar too. " )
( train_assamesemale_05230 " i will show you what happens to people of your kind. " )
( train_assamesemale_05231 " get out of my sight. " )
( train_assamesemale_05232 " the woodcutters daughter ran home in tears. " )
( train_assamesemale_05233 " but an hour later soldiers came to the door. " )
( train_assamesemale_05234 " they arrested the woodcutter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05235 " and carried him off to a public. " )
( train_assamesemale_05236 " square in front of the prison. " )
( train_assamesemale_05237 " then they locked his feet in the stocks. " )
( train_assamesemale_05238 " and left him there. " )
( train_assamesemale_05239 " the woodcutter had to suffer the taunts. " )
( train_assamesemale_05240 " and jeers of the passersby. " )
( train_assamesemale_05241 " some people were kinder though. " )
( train_assamesemale_05242 " and even threw him scraps of food. " )
( train_assamesemale_05243 " now that evening was friday eve. " )
( train_assamesemale_05244 " as the sun set the woodcutter cast his thoughts. " )
( train_assamesemale_05245 " over all that had happened to him in the past weeks. " )
( train_assamesemale_05246 " all at once he cried out. " )
( train_assamesemale_05247 " oh what a foolish ungrateful wretch. " )
( train_assamesemale_05248 " i am did not the dervish say to share. " )
( train_assamesemale_05249 " what i have each friday eve and tell. " )
( train_assamesemale_05250 " yet i have not done it once. " )
( train_assamesemale_05251 " just then a packet of chickpeas. " )
( train_assamesemale_05252 " and raisins landed by the woodcutter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05253 " when he looked up he did not see who had thrown it. " )
( train_assamesemale_05254 " but he did see a beggar boy coming by. " )
( train_assamesemale_05255 " young friend called the woodcutter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05256 " please share this with me while i tell you a story. " )
( train_assamesemale_05257 " the boy sat down and gratefully took what was offered. " )
( train_assamesemale_05258 " as he ate the woodcutter related. " )
( train_assamesemale_05259 " everything that had happened. " )
( train_assamesemale_05260 " from when his daughter asked for date cakes to. " )

( train_assamesemale_05264 " and the story was good too. " )
( train_assamesemale_05265 " i hope it has a happy ending. " )
( train_assamesemale_05266 " the beggar boy went on his way. " )
( train_assamesemale_05267 " but had only gone a block. " )
( train_assamesemale_05268 " when a rich merchant stopped him. " )

( train_assamesemale_05276 " and again she went down to the lake for a swim. " )
( train_assamesemale_05277 " she was about to step into the water. " )
( train_assamesemale_05278 " when she saw the reflection of her necklace. " )
( train_assamesemale_05279 " she looked up into the tree. " )
( train_assamesemale_05280 " and there was the necklace itself right. " )
( train_assamesemale_05281 " where she had left it. " )
( train_assamesemale_05282 " that woodcutters daughter did not take it at all. " )
( train_assamesemale_05283 " by the end of the day. " )

( train_assamesemale_05285 " and his daughter was back in the palace. " )
( train_assamesemale_05286 " and every friday after that the woodcutter always remembered. " )
( train_assamesemale_05287 " mistress pennington ran to pick up the mail. " )

( train_assamesemale_05293 " the wind blew fiercely and snatched the newly recovered mail. " )
( train_assamesemale_05294 " from mistress penningtons hands and blew it. " )
( train_assamesemale_05295 " even further into the house. " )
( train_assamesemale_05296 " tommy ran outside and the door slammed shut. " )
( train_assamesemale_05297 " outside yellow gold and red leaves were leaping from. " )

( train_assamesemale_05300 " tommy watched in fascination. " )
( train_assamesemale_05301 " if i was a leaf i would fly. " )
( train_assamesemale_05302 " clear across the world tommy thought. " )
( train_assamesemale_05303 " and then ran out into the yard among the swirl of colours. " )
( train_assamesemale_05304 " pennington came to the front porch. " )
( train_assamesemale_05305 " tommy i have your jacket please put it on. " )
( train_assamesemale_05306 " however there was no tommy in the front yard. " )

( train_assamesemale_05313 " this is fun tommy thought. " )
( train_assamesemale_05314 " the maple leaf blew in front of him. " )
( train_assamesemale_05315 " it was bright red with well defined veins. " )
( train_assamesemale_05316 " the sunlight shone through it giving it a brilliance. " )
( train_assamesemale_05317 " never before seen by a little boys eyes. " )
( train_assamesemale_05318 " where do you think we are going. " )
( train_assamesemale_05319 " tommy asked the leaf does it matter. " )
( train_assamesemale_05320 " the leaf replied have fun life is short. " )
( train_assamesemale_05321 " i beg to differ an older leaf said suddenly. " )
( train_assamesemale_05322 " coming beside them the journey may be short. " )
( train_assamesemale_05323 " but the end is the beginning. " )
( train_assamesemale_05324 " tommy pondered this the best a leaf could ponder. " )
( train_assamesemale_05325 " where do we end up if the wind blows you. " )
( train_assamesemale_05326 " in that direction the old leaf said. " )
( train_assamesemale_05327 " if you are blown in that direction you will fly high. " )
( train_assamesemale_05328 " into the air and see things that no leaf has seen before. " )
( train_assamesemale_05329 " follow me to the city dump the maple leaf said. " )
( train_assamesemale_05330 " most of my friends are there. " )
( train_assamesemale_05331 " the wind blew tommy and the maple leaf along. " )
( train_assamesemale_05332 " tommy thought of his choices. " )
( train_assamesemale_05333 " he wanted to continue to play. " )

( train_assamesemale_05367 " one day he would see what the old leaf had. " )
( train_assamesemale_05368 " a man hired an ass from another man. " )

( train_assamesemale_05380 " one thing and the owner saying the other. " )
( train_assamesemale_05381 " then they began to fight. " )

( train_assamesemale_05930 " we may go wrong many times. " )
( train_assamesemale_05931 " and should seek and accept the advice. " )
( train_assamesemale_05932 " suggestions provided by others. " )
( train_assamesemale_05933 " an old man was living with his three sons. " )
( train_assamesemale_05934 " in a deserted village located in the vicinity of a desert. " )
( train_assamesemale_05935 " he earned for his life with his seventeen camels. " )
( train_assamesemale_05936 " he used to rent out camels. " )
( train_assamesemale_05937 " as means of shipping in the desert. " )
( train_assamesemale_05938 " one day he passed away and he had a will. " )
( train_assamesemale_05939 " leaving his assets for his three sons. " )
( train_assamesemale_05940 " after all the funeral obligations. " )
( train_assamesemale_05941 " the three sons read the will. " )
( train_assamesemale_05942 " while he divided all the properties. " )
( train_assamesemale_05943 " he had into three equal parts. " )
( train_assamesemale_05944 " he divided the seventeen camels in a different way. " )
( train_assamesemale_05945 " it was not shared equally among the three. " )
( train_assamesemale_05946 " as seventeen is an odd number and prime number. " )
( train_assamesemale_05947 " which cannot be divided. " )
( train_assamesemale_05948 " the deceased old man stated. " )
( train_assamesemale_05949 " the eldest son will own half of the seventeen camels. " )
( train_assamesemale_05950 " and the middle one will get. " )
( train_assamesemale_05951 " the one third of the seventeen camels. " )
( train_assamesemale_05952 " and the youngest one will get. " )
( train_assamesemale_05953 " his share of camel as one ninth. " )
( train_assamesemale_05954 " all of them were stunned to read the will. " )
( train_assamesemale_05955 " and questioned how to divide seventeen camels. " )
( train_assamesemale_05956 " as mentioned in the will. " )
( train_assamesemale_05957 " it neither possible to divide seventeen camels. " )
( train_assamesemale_05958 " and the half of the seventeen camels to the eldest one. " )
( train_assamesemale_05959 " nor able to divide the camels to the other two sons. " )
( train_assamesemale_05960 " they spent several days to divide the camel. " )
( train_assamesemale_05961 " but none could find the answer. " )
( train_assamesemale_05962 " they finally took this issue. " )
( train_assamesemale_05963 " to the wise man in their village. " )
( train_assamesemale_05964 " the wise man heard the problem. " )
( train_assamesemale_05965 " and instantly found a solution. " )
( train_assamesemale_05966 " he asked them to bring all seventeen camels. " )
( train_assamesemale_05967 " to divide them as intended by their father. " )
( train_assamesemale_05968 " the sons brought the camels to the place. " )
( train_assamesemale_05969 " the wise man added a camel owned by him. " )
( train_assamesemale_05970 " and made it count eighteen. " )
( train_assamesemale_05971 " now he asked the first son to read the will. " )
( train_assamesemale_05972 " he get half the camels. " )
( train_assamesemale_05973 " which now counts to eighteen divided by two is nine camels. " )
( train_assamesemale_05974 " the eldest one got nine camels as his share. " )
( train_assamesemale_05975 " remaining camels left nine camels. " )
( train_assamesemale_05976 " the wise man asked the second son to read the will. " )
( train_assamesemale_05977 " he was assigned a share of one third of the total camels. " )
( train_assamesemale_05978 " it comes to eighteen divided by three is six camels. " )
( train_assamesemale_05979 " second son got six camels as his share. " )
( train_assamesemale_05980 " total camels shared by the elder sons fifteen camels. " )
( train_assamesemale_05981 " we should never say that he has forgotten us. " )
( train_assamesemale_05982 " one hot day a thirsty crow flew. " )
( train_assamesemale_05983 " all over the fields looking for water. " )
( train_assamesemale_05984 " for a long time she could not find any. " )
( train_assamesemale_05985 " she felt very weak almost giving up hope. " )
( train_assamesemale_05986 " suddenly she saw a water jug below her. " )
( train_assamesemale_05987 " she flew straight down to see. " )
( train_assamesemale_05988 " if there was any water inside. " )
( train_assamesemale_05989 " yes she could see some water inside the jug. " )
( train_assamesemale_05990 " the crow tried to push her head into the jug. " )
( train_assamesemale_05991 " sadly she found that the neck of the jug was too narrow. " )
( train_assamesemale_05992 " then she tried to push the jug down. " )
( train_assamesemale_05993 " for the water to flow out. " )
( train_assamesemale_05994 " she found that the jug was too heavy. " )
( train_assamesemale_05995 " the crow thought hard for a while. " )
( train_assamesemale_05996 " then looking around her she saw some pebbles. " )
( train_assamesemale_05997 " she suddenly had a good idea. " )
( train_assamesemale_05998 " she started picking up the pebbles one by one. " )
( train_assamesemale_05999 " dropping each into the jug. " )
( train_assamesemale_06000 " as more and more pebbles filled the jug. " )
( train_assamesemale_06001 " the water level kept rising. " )
( train_assamesemale_06002 " soon it was high enough for the crow to drink. " )
( train_assamesemale_06003 " her plan had worked. " )
( train_assamesemale_06004 " if you try hard enough. " )
( train_assamesemale_06005 " you may soon find an answer to your problem. " )
( train_assamesemale_06006 " there was a green and fresh pasture. " )
( train_assamesemale_06007 " in which three cows lived a white cow a black cow. " )
( train_assamesemale_06008 " and a reddish brown one the cows were kind to each other. " )
( train_assamesemale_06009 " they were nice to each other. " )
( train_assamesemale_06010 " they used to graze in the meadow together. " )
( train_assamesemale_06011 " and they used to sleep near each other. " )
( train_assamesemale_06012 " till it happened one day the reddish brown coloured lion. " )
( train_assamesemale_06013 " of the forest happened to pass that way. " )
( train_assamesemale_06014 " the lion was unhappy it was hungry. " )

( train_assamesemale_06016 " on catching sight of the cows it became glad. " )
( train_assamesemale_06017 " but could not attack them. " )
( train_assamesemale_06018 " because they were together. " )
( train_assamesemale_06019 " so the lion sat in a corner. " )
( train_assamesemale_06020 " and waited till the cows would separate from each other. " )
( train_assamesemale_06021 " the cows were together. " )
( train_assamesemale_06022 " and would not part away from each other. " )
( train_assamesemale_06023 " because they knew that if they were together. " )
( train_assamesemale_06024 " no predator could attack them. " )
( train_assamesemale_06025 " the lion lay in ambush nearby for two or three days. " )
( train_assamesemale_06026 " but the cows continued to remain together. " )
( train_assamesemale_06027 " and would not separate from each other. " )
( train_assamesemale_06028 " the lion became unhappy a plan occurred to it. " )
( train_assamesemale_06029 " it went towards the cows greeted them and said. " )
( train_assamesemale_06030 " how are you my friends are you fine. " )
( train_assamesemale_06031 " i have been remembering you for a long time. " )
( train_assamesemale_06032 " but because i am too busy. " )

( train_assamesemale_06035 " and see you from near and visit you. " )
( train_assamesemale_06036 " the cow said sir your coming has really pleased us. " )
( train_assamesemale_06037 " and brightened our pasture. " )
( train_assamesemale_06038 " the lion said i have always remembered you. " )
( train_assamesemale_06039 " and have ever ordered a better pasture. " )
( train_assamesemale_06040 " made ready for you reddish brown cow said. " )
( train_assamesemale_06041 " sir you have really obliged us. " )
( train_assamesemale_06042 " and we are very thankful to you. " )
( train_assamesemale_06043 " both the white and the black cows were troubled. " )
( train_assamesemale_06044 " by what the reddish brown cow said. " )
( train_assamesemale_06045 " and were grieved at its thoughtlessness. " )
( train_assamesemale_06046 " they feared lest it should be deceived. " )
( train_assamesemale_06047 " they said to each other. " )
( train_assamesemale_06048 " which forest has not got a better pasture. " )
( train_assamesemale_06049 " they does the reddish brown cow believe what the lion says. " )
( train_assamesemale_06050 " does not it know that lions seek. " )

( train_assamesemale_06053 " and more a close friend of the lion each day. " )
( train_assamesemale_06054 " the black cow and the white cow advised it. " )
( train_assamesemale_06055 " as much as they could but with no avail. " )
( train_assamesemale_06056 " one day the lion said to the reddish brown cow. " )
( train_assamesemale_06057 " you know that the colour of our bodies is dark. " )
( train_assamesemale_06058 " and that the colour of the body of the white cow is light. " )
( train_assamesemale_06059 " and you also know that the light colour. " )
( train_assamesemale_06060 " is the opposite of the dark colour. " )
( train_assamesemale_06061 " it could be very good if i eat the white cow. " )
( train_assamesemale_06062 " so that there will be no difference among us any longer. " )
( train_assamesemale_06063 " and that we will be able to live together well. " )
( train_assamesemale_06064 " the reddish brown cow accepted. " )

( train_assamesemale_06081 " in this forest we all will be of the same colour. " )
( train_assamesemale_06082 " the reddish brown cow accepted. " )

( train_assamesemale_07049 " The princess Fourbette was accompanied by four thousand mules. " )

( train_assamesemale_07060 " What is the matter said the king. " )
( train_assamesemale_07061 " Why does my sweet and sensible Blondine weep. " )
( train_assamesemale_07062 " like a bad little girl. " )
( train_assamesemale_07063 " Papa dear papa cried Blondine throwing herself. " )
( train_assamesemale_07064 " into the arms of the king. " )
( train_assamesemale_07065 " do not give me into the hands of this princess. " )
( train_assamesemale_07066 " I am afraid of her eyes are cruel. " )
( train_assamesemale_07067 " The king was much surprised. " )
( train_assamesemale_07068 " He turned so suddenly towards the princess. " )
( train_assamesemale_07069 " Fourbette that she had no time to control herself. " )
( train_assamesemale_07070 " and he perceived the terrible glance. " )
( train_assamesemale_07071 " with which she regarded the little Blondine. " )
( train_assamesemale_07072 " Benin immediately resolved that Blondine should be wholly separated. " )
( train_assamesemale_07073 " from the new queen and remain as before. " )
( train_assamesemale_07074 " under the exclusive protection of the nurse. " )
( train_assamesemale_07075 " who had taken care of her and who loved her tenderly. " )
( train_assamesemale_07076 " The queen thus saw Blondine rarely. " )
( train_assamesemale_07077 " and when she met her by chance. " )
( train_assamesemale_07078 " she could not wholly dissimulate. " )
( train_assamesemale_07079 " the hatred she felt for her. " )
( train_assamesemale_07080 " About a year from that time a daughter was born. " )
( train_assamesemale_07081 " to the queen Fourbette. " )
( train_assamesemale_07082 " She was named Brunette because of her dark hair. " )
( train_assamesemale_07083 " which was black as the ravens wing. " )
( train_assamesemale_07084 " Brunette was pretty but not so lovely as Blondine. " )
( train_assamesemale_07085 " more over she was as wicked as her mother. " )
( train_assamesemale_07086 " She detested Blondine and played all sorts of cruel. " )
( train_assamesemale_07087 " tricks upon her bit her pinched her pulled her hair. " )
( train_assamesemale_07088 " broke her toys and tore her beautiful dresses. " )
( train_assamesemale_07089 " The good little Blondine was never in a passion. " )
( train_assamesemale_07090 " with her sister but always tried to make excuses for her conduct. " )
( train_assamesemale_07091 " Oh papa she said to the king do not scold Brunette. " )
( train_assamesemale_07092 " she is so little she does not know. " )
( train_assamesemale_07093 " that she grieves me when she breaks my toys. " )
( train_assamesemale_07094 " It is only in play that she bites me pulls my hair and pinches me. " )
( train_assamesemale_07095 " The good king embraced his little daughter. " )
( train_assamesemale_07096 " and was silent but she knew that Brunette was cruel and wicked. " )
( train_assamesemale_07097 " that Blondine was too gentle and good to excuse her. " )
( train_assamesemale_07098 " He loved Blondine therefore more and more from day to day. " )
( train_assamesemale_07099 " and his heart grew cold to Brunette. " )
( train_assamesemale_07100 " The ambitious queen Fourbette saw all this clearly. " )
( train_assamesemale_07101 " and hated intensely the innocent and gentle Blondine. " )
( train_assamesemale_07102 " If she had not feared the rage of the king. " )
( train_assamesemale_07103 " she would have made Blondine the most wretched child in the world. " )
( train_assamesemale_07104 " Benin had commanded that Blondine should never be left alone with the queen. " )
( train_assamesemale_07105 " He was known to be just and good. " )
( train_assamesemale_07106 " but he punished disobedience severely. " )
( train_assamesemale_07107 " and the queen herself dared not defy his commands. " )
( train_assamesemale_07108 " When Blondine entered the forest she commenced. " )
( train_assamesemale_07109 " gathering the beautiful branches of lilacs. " )
( train_assamesemale_07110 " She rejoiced in their profusion and delighted in their fragrance. " )
( train_assamesemale_07111 " As she made her selection it seemed to her. " )
( train_assamesemale_07112 " that those which were more distant were still more beautiful. " )
( train_assamesemale_07113 " so she emptied her apron and her hat. " )
( train_assamesemale_07114 " which were both full and filled them again and again " )
( train_assamesemale_07115 " Blondine had been thus busily occupied for about an hour. " )
( train_assamesemale_07116 " She began to suffer from the heat and to feel great fatigue. " )
( train_assamesemale_07117 " She found the branches of lilacs heavy to carry. " )
( train_assamesemale_07118 " and thought it was time to return to the palace. " )
( train_assamesemale_07119 " She looked around and saw herself surrounded with lilacs. " )
( train_assamesemale_07120 " She called Gourmandinet but no one replied. " )
( train_assamesemale_07121 " I have wandered further than I intended said Blondine. " )
( train_assamesemale_07122 " I will return at once though I am very weary. " )
( train_assamesemale_07123 " Gourmandinet will hear me and will surely come to meet me. " )
( train_assamesemale_07124 " Blondine walked on rapidly for some time. " )
( train_assamesemale_07125 " but she could not find the boundaries of the forest. " )
( train_assamesemale_07126 " Many times she called anxiously upon Gourmandinet. " )
( train_assamesemale_07127 " but he did not respond and at last she became terribly frightened. " )
( train_assamesemale_07128 " What will become of me all alone in this vast forest. " )
( train_assamesemale_07129 " What will my poor papa think when I do not return. " )
( train_assamesemale_07130 " And Gourmandinet how will he dare go back to the palace without me. " )
( train_assamesemale_07131 " He will be scolded perhaps beaten. " )
( train_assamesemale_07132 " and all this is my fault because. " )
( train_assamesemale_07133 " I would leave my carriage to gather lilacs. " )
( train_assamesemale_07134 " Unfortunate girl that I am I shall die of hunger. " )
( train_assamesemale_07135 " and thirst in this forest. " )
( train_assamesemale_07136 " if the wolves do not eat me up this night. " )
( train_assamesemale_07137 " Weeping bitterly Blondine fell on the ground. " )
( train_assamesemale_07138 " at the foot of a large tree. " )
( train_assamesemale_07139 " She wept a long time. " )
( train_assamesemale_07140 " At last her great fatigue mastered her grief. " )
( train_assamesemale_07141 " She placed her little head upon her bundle of lilacs and slept peacefully. " )
( train_assamesemale_07142 " BEAUMINON had entered by a little passage. " )
( train_assamesemale_07143 " which seemed made expressly for him. " )
( train_assamesemale_07144 " and had probably given notice to someone at the castle. " )
( train_assamesemale_07145 " as the gate opened without Blondine having called. " )
( train_assamesemale_07146 " She entered the court yard but saw no one. " )
( train_assamesemale_07147 " The door of the castle opened of itself. " )
( train_assamesemale_07148 " Blondine entered the vestibule which was of rare white marble. " )
( train_assamesemale_07149 " All the doors of the castle now opened like the first. " )
( train_assamesemale_07150 " and the princess passed through a suite of beautiful rooms. " )
( train_assamesemale_07151 " At last in the back part of a charming salon furnished. " )
( train_assamesemale_07152 " with blue and gold she perceived a white hind. " )
( train_assamesemale_07153 " lying upon a bed of fine and fragrant grasses. " )
( train_assamesemale_07154 " Beau Minon stood near her. " )
( train_assamesemale_07155 " The pretty hind saw Blondine arose and approached her. " )
( train_assamesemale_07156 " You are most welcome Blondine said she. " )
( train_assamesemale_07157 " My son Beau Minon and I have expected you for a long time. " )
( train_assamesemale_07158 " At these words Blondine was much frightened. " )
( train_assamesemale_07159 " Take courage princess you are with friends. " )
( train_assamesemale_07160 " I know the king your father. " )
( train_assamesemale_07161 " and I love him and I love you also. " )
( train_assamesemale_07162 " Oh madam said Blondine if you know the king. " )
( train_assamesemale_07163 " my father I pray you to take me to him. " )
( train_assamesemale_07164 " My absence must make him very wretched. " )
( train_assamesemale_07165 " My dear Blondine said the hind whose name was BonneBiche. " )
( train_assamesemale_07166 " sighing it is not in my power to conduct you to your father. " )
( train_assamesemale_07167 " You are in the hands of the magician of the Forest of Lilacs. " )
( train_assamesemale_07168 " I myself am subject to his power which is superior to mine. " )
( train_assamesemale_07169 " but I can send soft dreams to your father. " )
( train_assamesemale_07170 " which will reassure him as to your fate. " )
( train_assamesemale_07171 " and let him know that you are safe with him. " )
( train_assamesemale_07172 " Oh madam said Blondine in an agony of grief. " )
( train_assamesemale_07173 " shall I never again see my father whom I love so tenderly. " )
( train_assamesemale_07174 " Dear Blondine do not distress yourself as to the future. " )
( train_assamesemale_07175 " Wisdom and prudence are always recompensed. " )
( train_assamesemale_07176 " You will see your father again but not now. " )
( train_assamesemale_07177 " In the meantime be good and docile. " )
( train_assamesemale_07178 " Beau Minon and i will do all in our power to make you happy. " )
( train_assamesemale_07179 " Blondine sighed heavily and shed a few tears. " )
( train_assamesemale_07180 " She then reflected that to manifest such grief. " )
( train_assamesemale_07181 " was a poor recompense for all the goodness of Bonne Biche. " )
( train_assamesemale_07182 " She resolved therefore to control herself and to be cheerful. " )
( train_assamesemale_07183 " Bonne Biche took her to see the apartment they had pre pared for her. " )
( train_assamesemale_07184 " The bedroom was hung with rose colored. " )

( train_assamesemale_07196 " Whose portraits are these madam. " )
( train_assamesemale_07197 " said Blondine to Bonne Biche. " )
( train_assamesemale_07198 " I am forbidden to answer that question dear Blondine. " )
( train_assamesemale_07199 " but this is the hour for dinner. " )
( train_assamesemale_07200 " Come Blondine I am sure you are hungry. " )
( train_assamesemale_07201 " Blondine was in fact almost dying of hunger. " )

( train_assamesemale_07600 " She did not remember that the Parrot could have no possible motive. " )
( train_assamesemale_07601 " for risking its life to render her a service. " )
( train_assamesemale_07602 " Blondine believed it though implicitly because of the flattery. " )
( train_assamesemale_07603 " which the Parrot had lavished upon her. " )
( train_assamesemale_07604 " She did not even recall with gratitude. " )
( train_assamesemale_07605 " the sweet and happy existence which Bonne Biche. " )
( train_assamesemale_07606 " and Beau Minon had secured to her. " )
( train_assamesemale_07607 " She resolved to follow implicitly the counsels of the Parrot. " )
( train_assamesemale_07608 " During the course of the day she said to Bonne Biche. " )
( train_assamesemale_07609 " Why madam do I not see among your flowers. " )
( train_assamesemale_07610 " the most lovely and charming of all flowers the fragrant Rose. " )
( train_assamesemale_07611 " Bonne Biche was greatly agitated and said in a trembling voice. " )
( train_assamesemale_07612 " Blondine Blondine do not ask for this most perfidious flower. " )
( train_assamesemale_07613 " which pierces all who touch it. " )
( train_assamesemale_07614 " Never speak to me of the Rose Blondine. " )
( train_assamesemale_07615 " You cannot know what fatal danger this flower contains for you. " )
( train_assamesemale_07616 " The expression of Bonne Biche was so stern. " )
( train_assamesemale_07617 " and severe that Blondine dared not question her further. " )
( train_assamesemale_07618 " The day passed away sadly enough. " )
( train_assamesemale_07619 " Bonne Biche was unhappy and Beau Minon very sad. " )
( train_assamesemale_07620 " Early in the morning Blondine ran to her window. " )
( train_assamesemale_07621 " and the Parrot entered the moment she opened it. " )
( train_assamesemale_07622 " Well my dear Blondine did you notice the agitation. " )
( train_assamesemale_07623 " of Bonne Biche when you mentioned the Rose. " )
( train_assamesemale_07624 " I promised you to point out the means by which you could obtain. " )
( train_assamesemale_07625 " one of these charming flowers. " )
( train_assamesemale_07626 " Listen now to my counsel. " )
( train_assamesemale_07627 " You will leave this park and enter the forest. " )
( train_assamesemale_07628 " I will accompany you and I will conduct you to a garden. " )
( train_assamesemale_07629 " where you will find the most beautiful Rose in the world. " )
( train_assamesemale_07630 " But how is it possible for me to leave the park. " )
( train_assamesemale_07631 " Beau Minon always accompanies me in my walks. " )
( train_assamesemale_07632 " Try to get rid of him said the Parrot. " )
( train_assamesemale_07633 " but if that is impossible go in spite of him. " )
( train_assamesemale_07634 " If this Rose is at a distance will not my absence be perceived. " )
( train_assamesemale_07635 " It is about an hour's walk. " )
( train_assamesemale_07636 " Bonne Biche has been careful to separate you as far as possible. " )
( train_assamesemale_07637 " from the Rose in order that you might not find. " )
( train_assamesemale_07638 " that means to escape from her power. " )
( train_assamesemale_07639 " But why does she wish to hold me captive. " )
( train_assamesemale_07640 " She is all powerful and could surely find pleasures. " )
( train_assamesemale_07641 " more acceptable than educating an ignorant child. " )
( train_assamesemale_07642 " All this will be explained to you in the future. " )
( train_assamesemale_07643 " Blondine when you will be in the arms of your father. " )

( train_assamesemale_07647 " Blondine promised and closed the window fearing. " )
( train_assamesemale_07648 " that Bonne Biche would surprise her. " )
( train_assamesemale_07649 " After breakfast according to her usual custom. " )
( train_assamesemale_07650 " she entered the garden. " )
( train_assamesemale_07651 " Beau Minon followed her in spite of some rude be buffs. " )
( train_assamesemale_07652 " which he received with plaintive mews. " )
( train_assamesemale_07653 " Arrived at the alley which led out of the park. " )
( train_assamesemale_07654 " Blondine resolved to get rid of Beau Minon. " )

( train_assamesemale_07657 " Beau Minon pretended not to understand. " )
( train_assamesemale_07658 " Blondine was impatient and enraged. " )
( train_assamesemale_07659 " She forgot herself so far as to strike Beau Minon with her foot. " )
( train_assamesemale_07660 " When poor Beau Minon received this humiliating blow. " )
( train_assamesemale_07661 " he uttered a cry of anguish and fled towards the palace. " )
( train_assamesemale_07662 " Blondine trembled and was on the point of recalling him. " )

( train_assamesemale_07667 " Courage Blondine in one hour you will have the Rose. " )
( train_assamesemale_07668 " and will see your father who weeps for you. " )
( train_assamesemale_07669 " At these words Blondine recovered her resolution. " )
( train_assamesemale_07670 " which had become to falter. " )
( train_assamesemale_07671 " She walked on in the path indicated by the Parrot. " )
( train_assamesemale_07672 " who flew before her from branch to branch. " )
( train_assamesemale_07673 " The forest which had seemed so beautiful and attractive. " )
( train_assamesemale_07674 " near the park of Bonne Biche became wilder and more entangled. " )
( train_assamesemale_07675 " Brambles and stones almost filled up the path. " )
( train_assamesemale_07676 " the sweet songs of the birds were no longer heard. " )
( train_assamesemale_07677 " and the flowers had entirely disappeared. " )
( train_assamesemale_07678 " Blondine felt oppressed by an inexplicable restlessness. " )
( train_assamesemale_07679 " The Parrot pressed her eagerly to advance. " )
( train_assamesemale_07680 " Quick quick Blondine time flies If Bonne Biche perceives your absence. " )
( train_assamesemale_07681 " you will never again see your father. " )
( train_assamesemale_07682 " Blondine fatigued almost breathless with her armstorn. " )
( train_assamesemale_07683 " by the briers and her shoes in shreds. " )
( train_assamesemale_07684 " now declared that she would go no further when the Parrot exclaimed. " )
( train_assamesemale_07685 " We have arrived Blondine. " )
( train_assamesemale_07686 " Look that is the enclosure which separates us from the Rose. " )
( train_assamesemale_07687 " Blondine saw at the turn in the path a small enclosure. " )
( train_assamesemale_07688 " the gate of which was quickly opened by the Parrot. " )
( train_assamesemale_07689 " The soil was arid and stony but a magnificent majestic. " )
( train_assamesemale_07690 " rose bush adorned with one Rose which was more beautiful. " )
( train_assamesemale_07691 " than all the roses of the world grew in the midst of this sterile spot. " )
( train_assamesemale_07692 " Take it Blondine said the parrot. " )
( train_assamesemale_07693 " you deserve it you have truly earned it Blondine seized. " )
( train_assamesemale_07694 " the branch eagerly and in spite of the thorns. " )
( train_assamesemale_07695 " Everywhere the furniture was good and comfortable. " )
( train_assamesemale_07696 " The kitchen was filled with pots and kettles. " )
( train_assamesemale_07697 " but there was nothing in them. " )
( train_assamesemale_07698 " Henry again put his thistle. " )
( train_assamesemale_07699 " to his nose and desired to have a good dinner served up. " )
( train_assamesemale_07700 " A table soon appeared. " )
( train_assamesemale_07701 " with good smoking soup. " )
( train_assamesemale_07702 " a splendid leg of lamb. " )

( train_assamesemale_07709 " When their hunger was thus appeased. " )
( train_assamesemale_07710 " the mother aided by Henry. " )
( train_assamesemale_07711 " took off the cloth. " )
( train_assamesemale_07712 " washed and arranged all the dishes. " )
( train_assamesemale_07713 " and then put the kitchen in perfect order. " )
( train_assamesemale_07714 " They then made up their beds. " )
( train_assamesemale_07715 " with the sheets they found in the presses. " )
( train_assamesemale_07716 " and went happily to bed. " )
( train_assamesemale_07717 " thanking God and the good fairy Bienfaisante. " )

( train_assamesemale_07726 " He wished for nothing superfluous. " )
( train_assamesemale_07727 " either in clothing or food. " )

( train_assamesemale_07729 " It is not known when they died. " )
( train_assamesemale_07730 " It is supposed that the Queen of the Fairies. " )
( train_assamesemale_07731 " made them immortal and transported them to her palace. " )

( train_assamesemale_07741 " and was three years younger than her sisters. " )
( train_assamesemale_07742 " She was as amiable as she was handsome. " )

( train_assamesemale_07763 " She became an accomplished musician. " )
( train_assamesemale_07764 " she knew how to draw and spoke several languages. " )

( train_assamesemale_07912 " in finding some means of getting rid of Roussette. " )
( train_assamesemale_07913 " and preventing Prince Charmant from seeing her again. " )
( train_assamesemale_07914 " Nothing more easy than that said the queen. " )

( train_assamesemale_08060 " Charmant scarcely knew whether to allow Roussette. " )
( train_assamesemale_08061 " to mount this unknown chariot. " )
( train_assamesemale_08062 " for he still feared some cunning wickedness. " )
